         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Word of God, and the general Conſent of the Chriſtian, and of much of the Heathen World, being agreed for a weekly day of reſt: And Opinions and Practice varying which day of the week is to be obſerved, ſome affirming it to be one day, and ſome another: And thoſe agreeing upon the day differing in the Grounds of its obſervation, and the time of its beginning and ending: And theſe Queſtions concerning a Moral Duty, to which All are weekly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obliged, do make it worth while to look into it, to find (if poſſible) whether the Queſtion be as doubtful as the many Treatiſes thereof have left it; and whether the Unreſolvedneſs which is upon and ſtill afreſh ariſeth in the Minds of Men, be incurable.</p>
            <p>And when we conſider the number and weight of Books and their Authors, for about an Hundred years laſt paſt, pleading for the firſt day of the week, as the weekly day of reſt, it is ſome marvel whence that Unreſolvedneſs does come, and how it is maintained, and (with ſome) gets Strength under many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſuppreſs it, private Conſciences raiſing ſometimes the old, and ſometimes new Objections and Doubts, which neither themſelves nor any Man or Book did yet ever anſwer to their ſatisfaction.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48100:3"/>
            <p>The plain Word and Law of <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſeeming expreſly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the obſervation of one day, and many writing for and keeping up another, Conſciences are commonly ſtartled out of all that ſettlement which they ſeem ſometimes to have gotten from the Opinions, good Intentions, Practice, Authority, and Books of Men, and are ſtill ſuſpicious that a poſitive Command of God (and that one of the ten Commands) requires poſitive Obedience from Man.</p>
            <p>Wherein that I may commu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>icate what I can, I premiſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, The Perſons herein eminently treated with being ſuch as are profeſſedly awed by a Principle of Subjection to the Will of Chriſt (if it can be known what it is), and who reſolve their Perſwaſion in Religion into the Word of God, and who acknowledge themſelves obliged to practiſe his Will, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it ſhall prove to be; I take this for granted,</p>
            <p>That whatever is the Mind of Chriſt in this (as in other Caſes) in his Word, ought to be obſerved by us all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, That Chriſt's Will in this is revealed to us in the Scripture, or no where.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who, becauſe they find not a Command for the firſt day in the Scriptures, do reflect upon them as not perfect, and reſort to Traditions, to make up what they ſurmiſe is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in them; and who, to ſupply the want of a particular Command for the Firſt day, lodge a general Power in the Church to make Laws in this Caſe, to bind after-Ages,</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That the Scriptures do teach us all Truths and Duties neceſſary to Salvation; and, that it is ſo full a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</note> in all caſes, that Chriſtians need not go down to what is not written, for direction what to do; <hi>Peace on them who walk according to this Rule, Gal.</hi> 6. 16.</p>
            <p>And if the Church had ſuch Power as ſome pretend, there being ſuch variety of Churches, which of the Churches ſhall give the World a Rule in this? And, if all Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been of one mind all along, (<hi>quo jure</hi>) by what Right could they alter any Law of God? And (after ſuch a looſe Principle admitted) where ſhall any man (and who ſhall) ſet Bounds to that looſe Principle? And generally the moſt Learned of the Prelatical, as well <hi>Romaniſts</hi> as others, go that way. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Inſtit. Book 2. chap. 8. ſect. 33, 34.</note> alſo lays the greateſt ſtreſs, for the obſervation of the Firſt day, upon the Authority of the Church; he ſays, the old Fathers have (not without reaſon of their choice)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48100:3"/> put, in place of the Sabbath-day, the day we call Sunday, (ſo Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> allows the alteration to be made by the old Fathers) but Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s particular Opinion in this caſe was, for a ſeventh part of every day.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe who think the Seventh day in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was ceremonial, and that keeping one day in ſeven, that is, the Firſt day of the week, is moral, and remaineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> calls this a <hi>trifling of falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>an infecting the people with a Jewiſh Opinion;</hi> and he adds, that <hi>ſuch do as much exceed as the Jews in groſs and carnal Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of thoſe again, (but thoſe few and mean) who are for the Seventh day, have run far into another Extreme, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to introduce ſome of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies which are all aboliſh'd by the death of Chriſt, and are nailed to his Croſs, and buried in his Grave; and by ſuch<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14.</note> conceits occaſion Slanders upon others, and diſcourage<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 15, 16.</note> further Enquirers; which Extravagancies I take to be the uſual Artifice of Satan, to prejudice and hinder us from uſing due means to giv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our ſelves or others that ſatisfaction we need in ſo weighty a caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by how much the more Wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings there are about this Queſtion, by ſo much the more it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that we do what we can to clear our way therein.</p>
            <p>And ſome who have written for the Firſt day are ſo confident, that they count all contrary Reaſoning vain Cavils, and ſay, they think they have fully proved that point.</p>
            <p>And ſome repreſent ſuch as think that Seventh day is ſtill the Chriſtian Sabbath, as Jews.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, ſame few of thoſe, who think the Seventh day the Chriſtian Sabbath, ſet out the Firſt-day-men, as declini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g the determining Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And theſe Heats are carried ſo high on both ſides, that the Bonds of Love are much broken, and Chriſtian Communion almoſt cut aſunder; which ways of ſpeaking and writing (as vehement) we much diſlike, and I am perſwaded many of both ſides (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do miſtake) do conſcientiouſly miſtake, and I hope (if it be poſſible to come at the certain knowledge of the Will of Chriſt our common Lord) would ſit down thereby; and a right way herein, we may well preſume, has been often and earneſtly ſought (on all hands) of Him about it, and the Scriptures and Hiſtories ſearched, and thoſe who love Chriſt are undoubtedly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48100:4"/> (or ought to be) willing to keep his Commands. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
            <p>And here (without prejudice) it cannot be denied, but thoſe worthy, learned, pious, and excellent Miniſters of Chriſt, and others, who have written ſo many elaborate Tracts for the Firſt day, have done it with good intentions, as thinking it for the Honour of Chriſt, to keep up a day in memory of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Nor can they or any others (without prejudice) blame thoſe who can find no Command in the Word for the Firſt day, if they look a little further (as they are weakly able) to learn what is the true Will of Chriſt in this, and what he would have his People do, and whether it be for his honour, that ſuch a Change be made by Men without a Command from him.</p>
            <p>That there are already many Treatiſes upon this Queſtion is notorious, but moſtly in favour of the Firſt day, whereof two of the faireſt I take to be that of Mr. <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and ſince Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> two learned men have alſo written upon the ſame Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Firſt day, (as it ſeems to me) obliquely to anſwer what Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> yields, who moved ſome Doubts, and left many confirmed, that there was need of looking further into the Queſtion; for, what he admits about the Seventh-day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sabbath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he doth not afterwards anſwer to their ſatisfaction; ſince which time (except two or three little Tracts, for the Seventh day, of which no notice is taken by any Writers that I know nothing) has paſt in Print about that matter, and ſo it has (for ought I hear) reſted for ſome years.</p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as the Advocates for the Firſt day have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally meant well, I purpoſe to avoid Reflections, and ſhall rather offer that little which (I think) God has given m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, with all the Candour I can, and leave the Effect with him.</p>
            <p>If we have been generally miſtaken in the true Sabbath, (as I doubt we have) 'tis high time we return to our Duty: And, in reading of ſome learned mens Writings about Sacred things, when they reaſon concerning the Moral Law and Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in general, we may ſee, That they then eſtabliſh, with many excellent words, their perpetual Obligation, ſhewing what a Summary the Law of God is of a Chriſtian's Duty.</p>
            <p>That all God's Laws are reaſonable.</p>
            <p>That it is a controuling the Divine Wiſdom to make any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in his Laws.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48100:4"/>
            <p>That Man's Glory in the World lies in his conformity to Chriſt, and our conformity to him lies in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ur keeping all his Commands; and that the Ten Commands are abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſt, and frequently by the Apoſtles, in<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 17.</note> the Evangeliſts and Epiſtles; and that they are a ſettled ſtanding Rule of our Obedience to the end of the world. Which are right and ſound Expreſſions. But when they write of the Seventh day, there they bring in many Diſtinctions, and take a liberty to add and alter; and if ſuch liberty were uſed in the reſt of the Commands, it would go far to make further altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in them.</p>
            <p>And whoſe will admit what is commonly affirmed about the Obligation of the Ten Commands, and that God's Commands are unalterable by Man; ſuch may, in a little time, reſolve this Queſtion: And it is to me ſomewhat obſervable, that (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Alteration in the ſecond Command about Images, by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and ſome few others, and in the fourth about the Seventh day, (as I think, made originally by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>) all the Wit of the World, ſince the Creation, has not pretended to mend any other of the Ten Commands.</p>
            <p>Our Queſtion is, If they can be aboliſhed, or in the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> or <hi>Tittle</hi> altered or amended in any part by Man; which, we doubt, cannot be without Reflection upon the Wiſdom of Chriſt the Law-giver.</p>

               <hi>v. 14. By him</hi> (that is, by Chriſt) <hi>were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, all things were created by him, and for him, v.</hi> 16. By which Scripture of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. I underſtand Chriſt as a principal Efficient of all things in Heaven and Earth, and that all things were created by him, to whom the Creation is eminently and particularly aſcribed, whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calleth <hi>Jehovah the Redeemer, who maketh all things, who ſtretcheth forth the Heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the Earth by himſelf, Iſa.</hi> 44. 24. &amp; 33. 6. Which I think eminently ſpoken of Chriſt; For, <hi>by him were all things created that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, viſible and inviſible, whether Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were created by him, and for him, Col.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d</hi> Proof. <hi>In the beginning</hi> of all things (that is, when the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the World were laid) <hi>was the Word, (John</hi> 1. 1, 3, 10.) that is, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. is called the <hi>Word of Life,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13. the <hi>Word of God; And the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God, John 1. 2. The Word was made Fleſh, (i. e.</hi> the Word that made the World aſſumed our Humane Nature) <hi>and dwelt among us, and we beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father,</hi> John 1. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> John 1. 3.</p>
            <p>What the Evangeliſt here calleth <hi>all things,</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calleth <hi>the Worlds, Heb.</hi> 1. 2, and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>all things that are in Heaven and Earth, viſible and inviſible,</hi> Col. 1. 16, which <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth the <hi>Heaven and the Earth,</hi> Gen 1. 1. <hi>Theſe were all made by Chriſt,</hi> John 1. 3.</p>
            <p>Which (as I think with others) does not exclude the Father from this work, <hi>who by the Son made the Worlds,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. (<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhith, by the Head,</hi> Gen. 1. 1.) nor the Holy Spirit, to whom the Creation is alſo aſcribed, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 4. &amp; 26. 13. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1, 2. and <hi>by the word of</hi> Jehovah (or by the word <hi>Jehovah, i. e.</hi> by Chriſt) <hi>were the Heavens made, and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth (i. e.</hi> by the Holy Spirit) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. which work is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently aſcribed to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by whom all things were made, and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> John 1. 3. In which place, <hi>viz. John</hi> 1. 3, we have an univerſal Aſſertion, that all things were made by Chriſt, and an univerſal Negative added, to prevent and anſwer all Objections; <hi>and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48100:5"/> without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> Which word, <hi>by him, John</hi> 1. 3. 10, and <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. (as I take it) explains the word <hi>Bereſhith, Gen.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not,</hi> John 1. 10. (<hi>who came forth from the Father, and came into the World,</hi> John 16. 28.) (<hi>And the Worlds were made by him, the Heavens and the Earth were made by him, and the World knew him not</hi>) the men of the World did not know him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, believe in him, or obey him; the Heathen knew him not, and but few of the <hi>Iſraelites, John</hi> 1. 26. although <hi>the World was made by him,</hi> Joh. 1. 10, which Goſpel of <hi>John</hi> doth much aſſert the Divinity of Chriſt; and here in this firſt Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 10, the Creation of the World by Chriſt; for if <hi>all things were made by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 3, and if <hi>the World was made by him,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 10, then the World was made by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and we ought to believe it: Which is the ſecond Proof I bring to prove that Propoſition, That <hi>the World was made by Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The third Proof I take from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. God, who at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, <hi>v.</hi> 1, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, <hi>by whom alſo he made the Worlds, Heb.</hi> 1. 2. And ſpeaking of Chriſt the Son, the Author of that Epiſtle ſaith, <hi>And thou Lord in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning haſt laid the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of thine hands,</hi> v. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. with which if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 21, 22, 25, 26, 27. you may ſee that ſpoken of Jehovah-Chriſt; who made the Earth and<note place="margin">See <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Attrib. <hi>pag.</hi> 473, 474, 475.</note> the Heavens, <hi>Gen. 2. 4.

And that the World which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of Heaven and Earth, was made by Chriſt, ſee <hi>Charnock</hi>'s Attributes, <hi>f. 229, 472, 476. And he that built all things is God, Heb.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48100:6"/>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> The Fourth Proof I take from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; Paul</hi> had clear knowledge in the Myſtery, which in other Ages was not made known, as it is now revealed by the Spirit, <hi>which from the beginning of the World hath been hid in God, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3. 9. The Myſtery which was revealed to <hi>Paul, v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, was foretold and known, but not ſo known as after the coming of Chriſt; nor was Chriſt, after his coming, ſo clearly and fully known, as He by whom the Father created all things.</p>
            <p>At the Creation, and ſome Ages after, there was no ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which difference was by Chriſt taken away, and the whole World of Believers reconciled to God by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32, which was not then, nor is yet underſtood by the <hi>Jews</hi> or Heathen <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but by Revelation was made known to <hi>Paul, v.</hi> 3. This in other Ages was not made known to the Sons of Men, as it is now revealed by the Holy Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 5, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be fellow-heirs with the <hi>Jews, v.</hi> 6, of which Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter, <hi>v.</hi> 7, to make all men ſee what is the Fellowſhip of the Myſtery, which from the beginning of the World had been hid in God, <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh was propheſied; <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of juſtifying the Heathen through Faith, was preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto <hi>Abraham, In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed, Gal.</hi> 3. 8, &amp; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. And ſo this Doctrine was known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſaw it in the Promiſes, and in the Type of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s being offered, <hi>Gen. 22. 18, Heb.</hi> 11. 19, which Myſtery was <hi>hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>Either of which four quoted Scriptures I think ſufficient to prove, <hi>That the World was made by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for an human Authority I quote the late Aſſemblys Confeſſion of Faith, <hi>chap.</hi> 4, of Creation; <hi>It pleaſed God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to create the World of nothing:</hi> (Which Confeſſion is a great Summary of the Chriſtian Faith.) And the Elders and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of the Congregational Churches, who met at the <hi>Savoy, anno</hi> 1658, in their Declaration of their Faith and Order, ſay the like; and ſo do the <hi>Antipaedo</hi>-Baptiſts, in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> printed in the year 1677.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48100:6"/>
            <p>The Second Propoſition. <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is</hi> Jehovah, is the Foundation of Chriſtianity; <hi>and other foundation can no man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 3. 11. Eph.</hi> 2. 20. Which Foundation is cleared by many, and in particular by <hi>Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> in his Tract on this Subject of the three <hi>Aelohim (i. e.</hi> Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys) God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, one and the ſame <hi>Jehovah,</hi> written about an hundred years ſince, who cites <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his ſecond Apology to <hi>Anthony;</hi> he cites alſo <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Moſes,</hi> and the greater and the leſſer Prophets compared with paſſages in the N. Teſtament, to prove that Chriſt is God, to which Book (being in Latin) I refer the learned Reader, and ſhall offer a few Scriptures (of many) which have confirmed me, and I hope may ſatisfie others, that Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take the firſt from <hi>Gen. 2. 4. Theſe are the generations of the Heavens and the Earth, when they were created in the day that</hi> Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah Aelohim <hi>made the Earth and the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>Jehovah</hi> is a Name proper to God, and incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable to any other, according to <hi>Pſal. 81. 18. That men may know that hou, whoſe name alone is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>art the moſt High over all the Earth:</hi> Iſa. 45. 5. <hi>I am</hi> Jehovah, <hi>and none elſe; there is no God beſide me.</hi> So <hi>Deut. 5. 35, 39. Iſa.</hi> 42. 8.</p>
            <p>Which Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſignifies God's Self-Exiſtence or Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Being, from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <p>To this effect <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> in his Hebrew Lexicon, explains this Name, as well as other Hebricians, which explication is genuine, and comports well with the Root <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from whence this great name is thought to be derived.</p>
            <p>And the word <hi>Aelohim</hi> (Scholars know) is of the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which word ſignifies <hi>Strongs, Potents, Mightys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hebrew word (<hi>Bara</hi>) render'd (<hi>created</hi>) is of the ſingular number, and ſignifies (<hi>he created.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Now, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4. I reaſon thus; He that made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth, was and is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt made the Heavens and the Earth, and therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That he that made the Heavens and the Earth is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is proved from that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt made the Heavens and the Earth, is proved before from <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 3, 10. from <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. from <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 10. and from <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48100:7"/>
            <p>And if that be ſo, then it follows, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which great Truth, that Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and that theſe Three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> as God has graciouſly opened it to us, by the help and light of the Old and New Teſtament, compared, may now be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what perceived throughout the Scriptures. In the beginning, (or by the Head) <hi>Aelohim (i. e.</hi>) the Mightys, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; <hi>he created the Heavens and the Earth, Gen.</hi> 1. 1. and the Spirit of God, <hi>Heb. Aelohim,</hi> the Mightys, <hi>he moved upon the face of the waters, Gen.</hi> 1. 2. and <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light, Gen.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he ſaid, <hi>Let there be a Firmament, Gen.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 9, 14, 20, 24.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man, Gen.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
            <p>So alſo <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he <hi>created Man in his own image, Gen.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he <hi>bleſſed them, v.</hi> 28. And <hi>Aelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> (the Mightys) he ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 29. And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he ſaw, <hi>that every thing he had made</hi> (was) <hi>very good, Gen.</hi> 1. 31. And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he ended his Work which he had created. And <hi>Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he <hi>reſted from all his work which he had created, Gen.</hi> 2. 2, 3. And then it is ſaid, that <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) he <hi>made the Earth and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Gen.</hi> 2. 4. And the ſame <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) who <hi>made the Earth and the Heavens, be formed Man, Gen. 2. 7. And he took Man, and he put him into the garden, v.</hi> 15. And <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah Aelohim</hi> (the Mightys) <hi>he drove Man out of</hi> Eden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 23, 24. And <hi>Jehovah Aelohim,</hi> (the Mightys) <hi>he ſaid, behold the man is become as one of us, Gen.</hi> 3. 22. And <hi>Jehovah</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Gen. 11. 6, Let us go down, and there let us confound their language. Gen.</hi> 11. 7, So <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> God, (<hi>Heb. Aelohim) They cauſed me to wander.</hi> So <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 35. 7, built an Altar, and <hi>there</hi> (Aelohim) <hi>they appeared to him.</hi> Which with other like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do ſomewhat open the Myſtery of the Trinity, and their Oneneſs throughout the Old Teſtament; which place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4. (compared as before) does prove the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be <hi>Jehovah, who made the Heavens and the Earth.</hi>

            <p>And here I pretermit many paſſages in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 1, where <hi>Jehovah</hi> he was ſeen by <hi>Abraham, And</hi> Jehovah <hi>he ſaid to Abraham, v. 13, 17. And</hi> Jehovah <hi>he went away when he had left communing with Abraham, v.</hi> 33. Which <hi>Jehovah</hi> I think was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who here appeared in the ſhape of a man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 2, the two others who were with <hi>Jehovah, Gen.</hi> 18. 2, ſeem to be the two Angels who went to <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 1.</p>
            <p>Which appearing of <hi>Jehovah</hi> to Man, as Man, gave Man a kind of foreſight of his after-intended Incarnation. See the like in the Garden of <hi>Eden, Gen.</hi> 3. 8, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The word of</hi> Jehovah (or the word <hi>Jehovah) came</hi> before <hi>to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram in a viſion, Gen.</hi> 15. 1, 4. and made him a great, perſonal and family Promiſe, <hi>v. 1, 5. and he believed in</hi> Jehovah, <hi>and he</hi> imputed <hi>it to him for Righteouſneſs, Gen.</hi> 15. 6.

            <p>So that if Chriſt made the World, then he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and if he be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> then he gave the Law; for, <hi>Jehovah</hi> gave the Law, and <hi>Jehovah Aelohim</hi> the Mightys, are one <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Aelohim <hi>ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>thus ſay to</hi> Iſrael, Jehovah <hi>the Mightys of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the God of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>he hath ſent me, this is my name for ever, Exod.</hi> 3. 15. And theſe <hi>Aelohim,</hi> (theſe Mightys) whoſe Name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> gave the Ten Commands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 1, 2. which Commands are called Chriſt's Commands; <hi>If ye love me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>keep my Commands, John 14. 15. He that hath my Commands, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me,</hi> Joh. 14. 21, 23.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond Command (againſt all uninſtituted Worſhip, by the word <hi>Peſel,</hi> which one late learned Writer ſeems willing to take out of the ſecond Command, as I doubt) for <hi>I Jehovah Aeloheka, Jehovah</hi> thy <hi>Aelohim,</hi> thy Mightys, <hi>Ael kana,</hi> a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God, where the Heb. word <hi>Ael</hi> is in the ſingular number, and may eſpecially point at Chriſt, as in other places it may point at the Father, and at the Holy Spirit: <hi>I</hi> Jehovah <hi>thy God;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48100:8"/> (and if God be ours, it is by Chriſt,) <hi>I</hi> Jehovah <hi>thy God, ſhewing mercy unto thouſands of them that love me</hi> [that love me] <hi>and keep my Commands, Exod.</hi> 20. 5, 6. Which agrees well with that of Chriſt, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commands, John</hi> 14. 15. Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Propitiation for our Sins; hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments: And he that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. Upon which fourth verſe a learned Paraphraſt ſaith, <q>He that profeſſeth the Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt, and calls himſelf a Chriſtian, and yet doth not ſincerely keep his Commandments, is a Liar, and he is not what he profeſſeth to be. <hi>And this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, 1 John</hi> 5. 3.</q> and <hi>this is love, that we walk after his Commands,</hi> 2d Epiſtle of <hi>John, v.</hi> 6. Know, that <hi>Jehovah Aeloheka</hi> thy Mightys, he is the <hi>Aelohim. Hael Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeman</hi> the Faithful <hi>El,</hi> the Faithful God, <hi>which keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love him and keep his Commands, Deut. 7. 9. Ye are my Friends, if ye do whatever I command you,</hi> John 15. 14. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, you ſhall abide in my love,</hi> John 15. 10. They are his Commands, who made the Heaven and the Earth, Jehovah <hi>he made the Heavens and the Earth, Exod.</hi> 20. 11. And <hi>he that made the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> Gen. 2. 4. he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>So that the Commands are Chriſt's Commands, and <hi>Jehovah</hi> giving the Commands, by conſequence Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And that Chriſt gave the Law, appears further by this;</p>
            <p>The Commands are ſaid to be given by Chriſt Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>whoſe voice</hi> (at the giving the Law) <hi>then ſhook the Earth, Heb. 12. 24, 25, 26. Who gave the Law and the Goſpel; Jeſus the Mediator</hi> ſpake in the Goſpel by his Blood, whoſe voice at the giving the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> did ſhake that Mountain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24, 25, 26. compared with <hi>Exod. 19. 18. Sinai</hi> was moved at the preſence of <hi>Aelohim,</hi> the <hi>Elohe,</hi> (both in the plural) the Mightys of <hi>Iſrael, Pſal. 68. 8. The mountains skipped, Pſal. 114. 1, 4, Tremble thou Earth at the preſence of the Lord,</hi> (Heb. <hi>Adoun,</hi> another of the Names of God, ſignifying a Stay or Pillar) <hi>at the preſence of the God of Jacob, Pſal.</hi> 114. 5, 6, 7. the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu,</hi> and ſeventy of the Elders ſaw, <hi>Exod. 24. 9, 10. Who ſpake unto Moſes face to face, Exod.</hi> 33. 9, 12. and <hi>no man hath ſeen the Father but the Son, John</hi> 1. 18. &amp; 6. 46. So that the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who appeared in the Mount, who gave the Law, was alſo and is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48100:9"/> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>bleſſed are they who do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rev.</hi> 22. 14.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither let us tempt CHRIST, as ſome of them tempted him in the wilderneſs, and were deſtroyed of Serpents, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 9.</p>
            <p>4. And I think I may offer another Proof from <hi>Numbers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehovah</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> directs <hi>Aaron</hi> how to bleſs the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Jehovah</hi> is thrice mentioned; <hi>Jehovah bleſs thee and keep thee; Jehovah make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; Jehovah lift up his countenance upon</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 6. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>thee, and give thee Peace. (Jehovah bleſs thee and keep thee.</hi>) Now, although bleſſing and keeping be from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, yet here they ſeem peculiarly aſcribed to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father, as he that bleſſed and kept his People, to whom Bleſſing is aſcribed in many places of the Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28, 22. And God is ſaid to have bleſſed Chriſt for ever, <hi>Pſal. 45. 2, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Keeping is aſcribed to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father, in that Chriſt prays to the Father to keep thoſe whom the Father had given to Chriſt, <hi>that they may be one as we are, (i. e.</hi> the Father and Chriſt are one) <hi>John 17. 11, 21, 22. I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the World,</hi> (which is Chriſt's Prayer to the Father) <hi>but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil, John</hi> 15. 17. So Bleſſing and Keeping ſeem eminently aſcribed to the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Elect are kept by the Power of God, through Faith, to Salvation, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 5. ſpoken of God the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Jehovah make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, Numb.</hi> 6. 25. Which ſhining upon us, and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son.</note> being gracious to us, may be from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, yet here they ſeem eſpecially to referr to <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> the Son.</p>
            <p>The ſhining of his Face ſeems the Love and Favour of God in Chriſt; <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved, Pſal.</hi> 80. 19. And how it is that we have the Favour of God, and are ſaved, but by Chriſt, I know not: <hi>And God hath ſhined in our Hearts in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48100:9"/>
            <p>(<hi>And be gracious unto thee, Num.</hi> 6. 25.) Now Grace came by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John 1. 17. The grace of God is given you by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 1. 4. The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you, 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 23. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 14. Phil. 4. 23. We believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt we ſhall be ſaved, Acts 15. 11. And the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you, Amen, 1 Theſſ. 5. 28. 2 Tim. 2. 1. &amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Jehovah</hi>'s Favour and Grace ſeem eminently to come from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>(Jehovah <hi>lift up the light of his countenance upon</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Holy Spirit.</note>

Which lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his Countenance, and giving Peace, may be from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Spirit, yet here they ſeem eſpecially to referr to <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Holy Spirit, by whom it is that his Countenance and Favour is eminently lifted up upon his People. Which may be intimated in (<hi>the Communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all) 2 Cor. 13. 14, &amp;c.</hi> And the application of Favour and Peace to the Conſcience, ſeems eminently the Work of the Comforter, <hi>John 14. 26. Ye received the Word with joy of the Holy Spirit, 1 Theſſ. 1. 6. Who is called the Eternal Spirit, Heb. 9. 14. And the fruits of the Spirit are Love, Joy, Peace, (Long ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Faith, Meehneſs, Temperance</hi>) Gal. 5. 22. And he that works theſe ſurely muſt be God; theſe and other Graces are wrought by the Holy Spirit; <hi>and God is Love, 1 John</hi> 4. 8, 16. Love is the Eſſence of God, and the Holy Spirit works Love, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for, <hi>the Holy Spirit is Truth, 1 John</hi> 5. 6, which I take to be alſo the Eſſence of God: And thoſe Fruits are not aſcribed to Men or Angels, but to God the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>And the like Bleſſing (to that in <hi>Numb. 6. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</hi>) is uſed by the Apoſtle; <hi>The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all, Amen, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 14. and is uſed, or ſome like words, by the Reformed Miniſtry of Chriſt, (and as I remember, by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> alſo) at the concluſion of their publick Work every where.</p>
            <p>And theſe Bleſſings may alſo be noted as Prayers to the Father, and to the Son, and to the H. Spirit, which proves alſo their Deity.</p>

            <p>And here I ſhall paſs by the many Miracles wrought by Jeſus Chriſt, whereof the four Evangeliſts are full, whereof ſome were done before Thouſands of Witneſſes, which Miracles (every one of them) are Proofs of his Deity.</p>
            <p>And I paſs by (after the giving the Holy Spirit) the Miracles wrought by the Apoſtles in his Name, and in particular, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Thouſands by a Sermon, which turning Men from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18, and <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, I think is ſtill a ſtanding Miracle in the World, and will ſo continue to the end of it, whereof whileſt ſome men find nothing in their private Converſation, nor in the effects of their publick Miniſtry, no wonder if they proclaim their Infidelity by ſpeaking and writing againſt Chriſt's Deity: Which Converſion and new Birth was, and is, and muſt needs be a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery to Unbelievers. And Chriſt is exalted to give Repentance, which none can give but he that is God: Such a change from Contraries are frequent in ſome Chriſtian Aſſemblies, and cannot be brought about but by <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Father's giving ſuch to Chriſt, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son's purchaſing and redeeming them, and <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Holy Spirit's converting and ſanctifying them; whereof we have alſo much in the Epiſtles which I paſs by, and ſhall offer a Caſe; After the Reſurrection of our Lord, he had appeared unto the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>but</hi> Thomas <hi>was not with them when Jeſus came; and the other Diſciples told</hi> Thomas <hi>that they had ſeen the Lord, but he ſaid, Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> Afterwards <hi>the Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, and</hi> Thomas <hi>with them, the doors ſhut, Jeſus came and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith to</hi> Thomas, <hi>Reach hither thy finger and thy hand, &amp;c. and be not faithleſs, but believing: And</hi> Thomas <hi>ſaid unto him, My Lord and my God,</hi> John 20. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Which caſe plainly intimates, that the reſt of the Apoſtles there did believe the ſame Truth before; which Confeſſion of <hi>Thomas</hi> Chriſt approves with, <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen</hi> (as <hi>Thomas</hi> did) <hi>and yet have believed</hi> (that Chriſt is our Lord and our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48100:12"/> God:) Whom after our Lord's Aſcenſion, <hi>and after they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, Peter</hi> preaches to be <hi>Jehovah, Acts</hi> 2. 4, 14, 22, 24, 25. And <hi>David, v.</hi> 25, ſpeaking concerning Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, I foreſaw the Lord alwaies before my face;</hi> which is quoted out of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. 8, where He whom <hi>Peter</hi> names the Lord, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> names <hi>Jehovah,</hi> by which Sermon about Three thouſand were converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. So that <hi>Peter</hi> preached Chriſt to be <hi>Jehovah; Jeſus Chriſt, which before was preached unto you, whom the Heavens muſt receive until the time of reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets ſince the World began, Acts</hi> 3. 20, 21, 26. (whereof you may before ſee a ſmall collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:) <hi>By the name of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth <hi>doth this man ſtand here before you whole; neither is there ſalvation in any other; for there is no other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, Acts</hi> 4. 10, 12.

            <p>Some defend this Truth from the Opinion of ancient Doctors and learned Fathers, (whereof I have ſeen a great collection) for whom I have due reverence, yet ſatisfaction to the Conſcience coming in ordinarily by the Word of God, I have rather choſen this familiar way by the Scriptures.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. The third Queſtion propoſed, is, <hi>Whether after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lord reſted on the ſeventh day; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>the ſeventh-day Sabbath was ſanctified and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by him, and was obſerved by him, who made the World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He that made the World <hi>reſted on the ſeventh day;</hi> for which we have theſe full Authorities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them,</hi> Gen. 2. 1. <hi>And on the ſeventh day</hi> God (Heb. <hi>Aelohim</hi> the Mightys) <hi>he ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the ſeventh day from all his work which he had made,</hi> Gen. 2. 2. <hi>For in ſix days</hi> Jehovah he <hi>made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and</hi> he <hi>reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> Exod. 20. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Sabbaths ye ſhall keep, for it is a ſign between me and you:</hi> A ſign whereby his People were diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the World; <hi>It is holy unto you, a perpetual Covenant: For in ſix days</hi> Jehovah <hi>made Heaven and Earth, and</hi> on <hi>the ſeventh day he reſted and was refreſhed, Exod. 31. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. And God did reſt the ſeventh day from all his works, Heb.</hi> 4. 4. Which is alſo a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation of the Deity of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. He that made the World ſanctified or made holy the ſeventh-day Sabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After God</hi> (Heb. Aelohim) <hi>ended his work,</hi> it is ſaid expreſly, <hi>and God</hi> (Heb. Aelohim) he <hi>bleſſed the ſeventh day, and he ſanctified it, Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore</hi> Jehovah <hi>he bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it, Exod.</hi> 20. 11. Bleſſed and ſanctified it, and ſo inſtituted it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Queſtion it appears, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt made the World, and in the ſecond, that Chriſt is <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
            </p>

                  </gap>,</hi> he <hi>reſted on the ſeventh day,</hi> and he bleſſed it, and he ſanctified it.</p>
            <p>So we have here the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who made the World, reſting on the ſeventh day; that is, obſerving it, and bleſſing, and ſanctifying of it, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) giving the inſtitution of it, and this to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (to all Mankind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction) who then were all in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, and that before the Sin and Fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> So this part of the Moral Law was in <hi>Adam</hi> given to him, and to all his Poſterity.</p>
            <p>And this recorded for the Glory of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſome pretend to greaten, by dedicating another day to him, which he never bleſſed, ſanctified, or obſerved, that I can find, nor has any where in the Scriptures either bleſſed, ſanctified, or commanded.</p>
            <p>Comparing this with what was before offered, That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt made the World, and that he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> I think this one Authority in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, ſufficient to prove, that <hi>he reſted on the ſeventh day,</hi> that <hi>he bleſſed the ſeventh day,</hi> and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and ſo inſtituted it, and no other day of the week: And to this Inſtitution I think do referr the words of our Lord, <hi>The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, Mat. 12. 8.

            <p>And that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> kept the Sabbath, appears from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Anſwer; <hi>Behold, the people of the land are many, and you Moſes and Aaron, make them ſabbatize</hi> (or keep the Sabbath) or reſt from their burthens, <hi>Ex. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

               <hi>Q 5. Whether the Ten Commands were given by Chriſt to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles? <hi>And whether the ſame weekly ſeventh-day Sabbath, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the giving the Law at Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>was obſerved during the Old Teſtament?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Commands were ſpoken by Chriſt, eminently, I think, appears under the ſecond Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That they were given by him, as well to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> as to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> may appear by God's creating <hi>Man in his own image, Gen.</hi> 1. 27.</p>
            <p>Which Image and Likeneſs eminently conſiſts and remarkably appears in the Soul, whoſe Nature is ſpiritual, and ordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; whoſe Faculties (wherewith GOD in Man's Innocency had enriched it) were a clear underſtanding of his Creator's Mind, and a rectitude of Will to obſerve his Laws; and we find <hi>Paul</hi> chiefly placeth this Image of GOD in Man in Knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. and <hi>in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, Eph.</hi> 4. 24. After the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Underſtanding was darkened, and the Will and Affections corrupted, and ſo they remain to this day, until Man be regenerated by Chriſt and his Holy Spirit, and ſo that firſt Image of God, wherein Man was created, (according to our meaſure) be by Grace reſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed, which brings converted Men and Women about again to much of that original Light and Knowledge of the Will of God, and to thoſe good Inclinations to keep his Laws, wherewith the Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt beautified,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48100:14"/> which Converſion of Man is called, the <hi>New Creature, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 17. and a <hi>Divine Nature, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4.

            <p>Now, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> at firſt were all in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Loins, and there was no ſuch Difference till the time of <hi>Heber, Gen.</hi> 10. 21, 24. and <hi>Abraham</hi> was of <hi>Heber</hi>'s Poſterity, and Chriſt, in the Genealogy is ſaid to be <hi>the Son of Abraham, Mat. 1. 11.

            </p>
            <p>And if we look into this Caſe, we may ſee, that as (now) when the Lord ſhall by Converſion renew his Covenant with the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael, thoſe branches broken off above ſixteen hundred years, ſhall be grafted in again, Rom.</hi> 11. 5, to 33. <hi>and they ſhall mourn over him whom their Fathers pierced, Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
            <p>So it was (then) with us <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the Bought with Money, which were not of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Blood, at the inſtitution of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, were to be circumciſed, as well as his own Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12. and Strangers, as home-born, paſſed alike under the Diſcipline of the Church, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 19. which ſhews, they were in Fellowſhip with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Strangers (if circumciſed) might keep the Paſſover at its firſt inſtitution, one Law was to the Stranger and to the home-born, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49.</p>
            <p>And ſo, for Offerings of a ſweet ſavour to the Lord, there was but one Law for the Strangers and for the <hi>Jews; As ye do, ſo he ſhall do, and as ye, ſo ſhall the ſtranger be before the Lord, Num.</hi> 15. 14, 15, 16. which Paſſover and Offerings were all before giving the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 20. So that the Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. was given to both.</p>
            <p>And the Lord would not have the Son of the Stranger who joyned himſelf to him, to ſay, <hi>The Lord</hi> had <hi>utterly ſeparated him from his People;</hi> and thoſe Strangers who joyn themſelves to him, to ſerve him, and to love the Name <hi>Jehovah, who keep his Sabbaths, he will make them joyful</hi> in his <hi>Houſe of Prayer,</hi> and accept their ſervices, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 1, to 7. And not only <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the Stranger, were alike eſtabliſhed a People unto him, <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 15.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48100:15"/>
            <p>And in the fourth Command 'tis ſaid of <hi>the ſeventh-day Sabbath, neither thou nor thy stranger ſhall do any work therein, Exod.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
            <p>So that before the Moral Law given, one Law was to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48, 49. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 14, 15, 16. and we may ſay, What Difference was there then, or is there now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and us? Thoſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> then, living and dying impenitently, had not Salvation by the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> thoſe of them or the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then, who joyned themſelves to the Lord, to ſerve him, and to love the Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (which, as I take it, was to love Chriſt) had Eternal Life by him, and ſo all ſuch now have, and will have to the end of the World. And altho' Circumciſion in its ſeaſon were a good Inſtitution, yet in the ſence above, it ever was and will be true, That <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion availeth any thing,</hi> but a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gal. 6. 15. In Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion, but Faith, which worketh by Love, Gal. 5. 6. which</hi> Love <hi>is the fulfilling of the Law, Gal. 5. 14. and the fruit of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as many as walk according to this Rule, Peace on them, and Mercy, Gal.</hi> 6. 16. Upon All, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and walk by Rule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Circumciſion is nothing, and Uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping the Commandments of God, 1 Cor. 7. 19. Col.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11. And upon the whole of this, it ſeems to me, the Law was given to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. And through Chriſt both Jews and Gentiles have acceſs by one Spirit to the Father, Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 14, 18. where you have alſo Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That the ſeventh-day Sabbath, after the promulgation of the Law by Chriſt, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> (and that ordinarily) was called by the name of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and by that name known and obſerved, I think, is agreed by all that I know, and is ſo plain throughout the Old Teſtament, that there needs little to be ſaid thereto: <hi>Six days thou ſhalt work, and on the ſeventh day thou ſhalt reſt, Exod.</hi> 23. 12. Upon the ſeventh day the Lord called to <hi>Moſes</hi> out of the Cloud, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 16. which probably was the firſt Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after the giving the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. which ſeventh day is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called, <hi>a ſign for ever between him and his People,</hi> and <hi>a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant, Exod.</hi> 31. 13, to 17. to diſtinguiſh his People from others. Where the Law of the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pool</hi>'s Annot. on <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 16.</note> Sabbath is confirmed, and eſtabliſhed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48100:15"/> and the reaſon given for the perpetuity of the Sabbath is ſuch, as hath its force till the end of the World; and it's fit and juſt men ſhould retain this Monument, or Memorial of the Worlds Creation, even till its Diſſolution. And this was whilſt the Lord was communing with <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, and before the giving <hi>Moſes</hi> the two Tables of Teſtimony, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 18. which they were to obſerve in <hi>Earing-time and Harveſt, Exod. 34. 21. And the ſeventh day ſhall be to you an Holy day, a Sabbath of reſt to</hi> Jehovah, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 2. which is repeated here, and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. before, to teach them to remember that Precept, above all their ceremonial Obſervations. And the Weekly Sabbaths are called, <hi>The Sabbaths of the Lord, v.</hi> 38. in a way of diſtinction from other days of Reſt; which alſo appears in the fourth Command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 9, 10, 11. afterwards we have the Judgment againſt the Stick-gatherer, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 32, 36.</p>
            <p>And after the Command renewed for <hi>lively, fiery</hi> (and not dead and formal) <hi>Morning and Evening Word and Prayer, Num:</hi> 28. 3, to 8. <hi>Jehovah</hi> alſo repeats the <hi>Law</hi> for the <hi>Sabbath, v.</hi> 9, 10. which <hi>Iſrael</hi> prophan'd, whereof we read much in the Prophets, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. is a Pſalm for the Sabbath day. <hi>I love thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above gold; yea, above fine gold I eſteem all</hi> (thy) <hi>Precepts</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning) <hi>all things right, Pſal.</hi> 119. 127, 128. As if he had ſaid, I make not all thy Commands void, as ſome do; nor am I partial in approving ſome, and rejecting or altering thoſe I like not, which croſs my Opinion, as others do; all thy Commands ever were, are, and ever will be right. Which I take to be the import of the Hebrew, leaving out the Verb there, and in many other places: <hi>And he that turneth away his Ear from hearing the Law, his Prayer is an abomination, Prov.</hi> 28. 9. (it ever was ſo, is ſo, and will be ſo) (<hi>an abomination</hi>) 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Jehovah, <hi>My Salvation is near to come,—Bleſſed the man that keepeth the Sabbath,—he will accept their ſervices, Iſa.</hi> 56. 1, 2, 6, 7. (ſuch ever were, are, and ever will be bleſſed.) Which place, referring to Goſpel-times, is the larger Promiſe, now.</p>

               <hi>The Covenant which</hi> Jehovah <hi>made with their Fathers, which they broke, Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32. 33. was the Moral Law: <hi>I will put my Laws in their inward parts, and write them in their Hearts,</hi> called <hi>an

            <p>The Lord charges <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as having changed his Statutes, <hi>therefore I, even I, againſt thee, Ezek.</hi> 5. 5, 6, 8.</p>
            <p>That the Sabbath was appointed as a ſign between him and his People, is often mentioned, which becauſe they polluted, he gave them Statutes not good, <hi>Ezek. 20. 12, 13, 16, 20, 21. 24. My Sabbaths they greatly polluted, v.</hi> 13. the Lord threatned them, not to bring them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe they polluted his Sabbaths, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. which ſhould be <hi>a ſign between him and them, v.</hi> 20, 21, 24. Which Weekly Sabbaths were to be a weekly keeping alive their Hopes of an Eternal Reſt with the Lord; that Reſt, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm, or keeping Sabbath in Heaven, <hi>which remaineth for the People of God, Heb.</hi> 4. 8, 9. of which the ſeventh-day Sabbath was and is a Pledge and Repreſentation.</p>
            <p>And the prophaning the Sabbath is reckoned amongſt the greater ſins of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe Miniſters hid their Eyes from his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 8, 26. &amp; 23. 38. After many Threatnings againſt <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and after the Promiſes in that Prophet of converting the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Reſurrection of the dry Bones, the Promiſe of Chriſt's Kingdom, God's Judgment on <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſion of the new Temple; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, The gate of the inward Court, that looketh toward the Eaſt, ſhall be ſhut the ſix working days, but on the Sabbath it ſhall be opened, for the Prince to enter and offer upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, Ezek.</hi> 46. 1, 2, 4. and a little after, that Prophet clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Prophecy, and God threatens to <hi>cauſe the Sabbath to ceaſe, Hoſ. 2. 11. And when will the Sabbath be gone, that we may ſet forth Wheat, Amos</hi> 8. 5.</p>
            <p>By all which I conclude, that the ſeventh day was the Sabbath till our Lord's Incarnation.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and other Voices of the Prophets, do ſhew how highly the Sabbath was valued by the Lord, who gave it to his People, and was ordinarily called by the Prophets (and afterwards by the Apoſtles) <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> or <hi>the Sabbath day;</hi> and thoſe terms of <hi>the Seventh day</hi> and <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> were Synonimous in the Church, noting all along throughout the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one and the ſame Seventh-day-Sabbath: And it is very obſervable, that the Old or New Teſtament do never call the Firſt day the Sabbath.</p>

            <p>Q. 6. <hi>If the Ten Commands (without any exception of the fourth Command, or any part or tittle of it) were confirmed by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, after his taking our Nature upon him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> After the Birth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Emmanuel, (i. e. God with us) Mat.</hi> 1. 18. 23. we find in that famous Sermon of his in the Mountain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. (which was about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his publick Miniſtry) Chriſt does prevent an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Hearers, who (in regard his manner of preaching was different from their Teachers) might ſuſpect that he intended to abrogate the Moral Law, or to alter it, or ſome part thereof, and to bring in another Law, and warns them not to imagine, that he came to deſtroy, diſſolve, or looſen the Law, but to fulfill it, <hi>viz.</hi> by his perfect Obedience exactly to obſerve it, and by his Word to eſtabliſh it a ſtanding Rule of Obedience to his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and People, to the end of the World: <hi>Till Heaven and Earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. So that all the Commands have the ſame Character, of the ſame Divine Authority, and do all (without excepting one jot or tittle) equally bind man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 19. And, that this place in <hi>Matthew</hi> referrs to the Ten Commands, I take to be generally agreed by Expoſitors, and by Writers for the Firſt day; the firſt Table whereof contains the method preſcribed by Chriſt, how to expreſs our Love to God; a part of which firſt Table is, to <hi>keep holy the ſeventh day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſecond Table contains our Love to Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39. And agreeable to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. is that of <hi>Luke, It is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than one tittle of the Law to fail, Luke</hi> 16. 14, 17. where our Saviour ſhews the ſcoffing <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> that he taught no new Doctrine contrary to the Law; but that <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhould paſs away, before one tittle of the Law ſhould paſs.</hi> The Interpretations of the Law by the <hi>Jews</hi> were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, but the Law ſhall remain as a ſound and certain Rule to his People, <hi>until the World ſhould have an end.</hi> Where I take it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as agreed, that Chriſt ſpake of the Ten Commands.</p>
            <p>As he does alſo when the Lawyer asked him, which was the Great Commandment in the Law? Chriſt anſwers, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart.</hi> And the ſecond is like unto it; <hi>Love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Upon which two hang all the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 35, to 40.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 28, 29, 30, 31. where Chriſt confirms the Ten Commands, and both Tables thereof, whereof the Law for the ſeventh day is a part, which ſeventh day thoſe who ſet up and ſubſtitute the firſt day ſo far lay aſide.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> leave out the ſecond Command againſt Images, and a late learned Proteſtant Writer excepts againſt a word or two in the ſecond Command, and what he meant thereby I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay certainly; but if he think it lawful to make ſuch Pictures, (as of a Glorious Light) from which occaſion may be taken of good Thoughts of God, he ſeems to me, under the ſpecious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that good Intention to break in directly upon thoſe words in the ſecond Command, [<hi>Lo tagneſeh leka temunati aſher baſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majim,] Thou ſhalt not make to thee any likeneſs that (is) in Heaven above,</hi> and to go very near the borders of Idolatry: that <hi>God is Light, (1 John</hi> 1. 5.) is true, but we may make no Image or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture thereof, for any ſuch purpoſe: <hi>Light</hi> is, as I take it, one of the words opening the Eſſence of God, and to make any Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Eſſence, ſeems to be of the Likeneſs of God; which I think, is forbidden in the ſecond Command. To ſay nothing of the word (<hi>As</hi>) in the Parentheſis, which ſeems ſomething a kin to an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor can this be excuſed by the good intention before, of taking up thence good Thoughts of God, which ſurely muſt be from making and looking upon that pictured Light to the end above, ſo dangerous it is to ſit looſe in Principles, from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Moral Law, or any part thereof. And to this looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the Commands, and to the not obſerving of them, I think I may aſſign the great Tranſgreſſions of this Age againſt all the reſt of the Commands, but I forbear: And how much farther ſuch Great, Learned, and Worthy men may go, unleſs God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them or reſtrain them, I know not, who by his Word, and therein by Promiſes of his Holy Spirit, hath furniſhed all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers with ſufficient matter for Good Thoughts of God.</p>
            <p>And thoſe take away theſe words out of the fourth Command, (<hi>the ſeventh day (is) the Sabbath of the Lord thy God</hi>) which has not only many <hi>Iotaes</hi> and <hi>Tittles, (i. e.</hi> Letters and Vowels) but <hi>Words,</hi> and is a whole Paragraph, but, I think, will not ſo paſs away: Conformity to which Commands is the Perfection of the Nature of Man.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo how very much is ſaid in the New Teſtament againſt <hi>Anomie,</hi> that is <hi>Lowleſneſs, Acts 2. 22, 23. Mat. 13. 40, 41. Mat. 23. 28. Mat. 24. 12. Rom.</hi> 6. 19.</p>

            <p>One great Article of the new Covenant is, <hi>I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts;</hi> (which includes the whole Moral Law.) And another Article is, <hi>Their Anomies I will remember no more, Heb. 8. 10, 12. Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17.</p>

            <p>As for thoſe Laws which we call Ceremonial, I take them to teach and Command Faith in Chriſt, who was veiled, and hid under Typical Ordinances, as Sacrifices and Altars, which in their very Nature ceaſed to be farther literally obſerved, when Chriſt the true Antitype was ſacrificed for his People, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Paſſover, and the then Prieſthood, were by his Death taken away, and Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, and another more excellent Goſpel-Miniſtry inſtituted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And the Epiſtles (eſpecially that to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) do open much of the Myſteries of Chriſt, and the many Benefits Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in him do receive by the ſeveral old and new Ordinances, now explaining one another, and I ſuppoſe may be of uſe for convincing the <hi>Jews,</hi> when their time of Converſion comes, and the Law of Sacrifices does diſcover how Man was juſtified from the Guilt contracted by tranſgreſſing any of the Commands, <hi>viz.</hi> by Chriſt (typified by the Sacrifices) and his Righteouſneſs: As the Judicials did ſhew how Tranſgreſſors ſhould be proceeded againſt by Magiſtrates, and by Miniſters, for there we find many Directions for the Diſcipline of tranſgreſſing Subjects by their Princes and Judges, and of Members of the Church by their then Paſtors.</p>

Which he that keepeth loveth Chriſt, and Chriſt will love him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf unto him, John 14. 21. And it is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than one tittle of the Law to fail, Luke</hi> 16. 17. And ſurely Chriſt does not there exclude the Law of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whereof one tittle cannot paſs away: And, let any man ſhew us what other Law it is that Chriſt there means: And if it be eaſier for Heaven and Earth, than for one tittle of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to paſs away, it will be impoſſible to take away the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, poſitively ſaid to be the Sabbath of the Lord: And if the Commands, and therein the Seventh day, ſtand as long as Heaven and Earth, they ſurely ſtand now, for the Heaven and Earth yet ſtand.</p>
            <p>And, our Lord farther confirms the Moral Law, by ſhewing what Sins they are which defile a man, <hi>Mat. 15. 3, 11, 18, 19. Evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, Falſe-witneſs, Blaſphemies.</hi> Now Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, and Falſe-witneſſing, are Sins againſt the Second Table; Blaſphemies, Sins againſt the Firſt Table; and Evil Thoughts, Sins againſt every Command in both Tables: The Scribes and Phariſees there tranſgreſſed the Commandments of God by their Traditions, <hi>v.</hi> 3.

The Command Chriſt charges them with, as making it of no effect, or of unlording it, <hi>Exod. 20. 12. Deut.</hi> 5. 16. is the Fifth Command, one of the Second Table.</p>
            <p>And that about their vain Worſhip, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, was againſt the Second Command in the Firſt Table; and ſo Chriſt, by thoſe inſtances, affirms both Tables.</p>

And ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48100:20"/> Chriſt there affirms the Moral Law; which, I think, does fully prove, that by the general word of <hi>Commands,</hi> Chriſt meant the Ten Commands; and if Chriſt meant the Ten Commands, and have confirmed and eſtabliſhed them by One, and much more by ſo many plain Scriptures, what Power on Earth can alter any one of them?</p>
            <p>The great Commiſſion which the Lord gives his Miniſters, is, to <hi>teach all Nations to obſerve all things</hi> (Chriſt doth not except the Seventh day) <hi>whatſoever I have commanded you, Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.

            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48100:22"/>
            <p>And I think all the Advocates for the Firſt day, as well as all the Reformed Chriſtians in the World, do agree, that Chriſt has ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all Righteouſneſs, and that he perfectly kept the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, whereof the Fourth was and is certainly one, and the Seventh day certainly part thereof, and that every true Believer has a part in Chriſt's perfect Obedience, and conſequently in his perfect keeping of the Seventh-day Sabbath. Which I think ſufficient for proving this point, that the Seventh-day Sabbath, and no other, was conſtantly obſerved by him.</p>
            <p>Q. 8. <hi>After the Lord Jeſus had ſo far perfected the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as to ſay it is finiſhed; and after his giving up his Spirit; if he reſted in Heaven, and his Body in the Grave (as 'tis ſaid,</hi> he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he ended the Work of Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2.)?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That he ſaid <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> bowed his Head, and gave up the Spirit, are the words in <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. Whether he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by <hi>finiſhed,</hi> or accompliſhed, that he had finiſhed, or was then ready by his Death to finiſh all that he was to do and ſuffer in this World, to reconcile Believers to his Father, and all that was foretold of him by the Prophets, there is little doubt (by thoſe who dream not of Purgatories); and that Man's Redemption, and all the typical Ceremonies of the Law, were now fulfilled and ended in Him, whom they prefigured; where Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of that which then preſently ſhould be, and in the yielding up of his Spirit was accompliſhed; although, it may be, ſome of the Types of Redemption were perfected when Chriſt aſcended into the Holy of Holies; as, the <hi>Aaronical</hi> and <hi>Levitical</hi> Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 4, 5. which having little relation that I know to the Sabbath, I pretermit.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt reſted in Heaven, appears by his giving up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into the Hands of his Father, <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. and when the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Evil-doer upon the Croſs prayed unto him, <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom; Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the laſt hour, and believing in Chriſt as his Saviour, whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as Lord, and to whom he prays, (which alſo prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Deity of Chriſt) intended by Chriſt's Kingdom, his Kingdom of Glory, and Chriſt's gracious Anſwer, That that day that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhould be with him in <hi>Paradice, viz.</hi> in Heaven, the place
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48100:22"/> and ſtate of eternal Bleſſedneſs, does confirm it beyond queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Chriſt gave up his Spirit into the Father's Hands, and did immediately, upon his expiring, paſs into Heaven.</p>
            <p>That his Body reſted in the Grave, appears by <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s taking the Body, wrapping it in a clean Linnen Cloth, laying it in his own new Tomb in a Rock, and by his rolling a great Stone to the Door of the Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>As alſo, by the Chief Prieſts ſaying to <hi>Pilate, Sir, we remember that he (viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſaid whilſt he was yet alive, After three days I will riſe again. Command then that the Sepulchre be made ſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the third day, leſt his Diſciples come by night and ſteal him away, and ſay to the people, He is riſen from the dead. Whereupon by</hi> Pilate'<hi>s order they went, and made the Sepulchre ſure, ſealing the Stone, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Watch, Mat.</hi> 27. 59, to 66. All which Caution and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Chriſt's then Enemies did the more certainly eſtabliſh the truth of his reſting in the Grave, and his Reſurrection which followed, and took away all pretences of aſcribing it to any other Power than his own, which was and is mighty, the Enemies themſelves (againſt their Intentions) being by this means made Witneſſes thereof; which Reſt of our Lord was no way diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Triumph of Satan and the then unbelieving <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nor by the Dejection and Sadneſs of ſome of his Diſciples. And his Body reſting in the Grave, appears alſo by his Reſurrection, atteſted by Angels, <hi>Mat. 28. 2, 3, 5. Mark 16. 5. Luke</hi> 24. 4.</p>
            <p>And, that He took particular care for the obſervation of the Sabbath after his death, appears by <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20. which flight there mentioned was not till Thirty Eight years, at leaſt, after his death; whereof more hereafter, in the Anſwers to Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Q. 9. <hi>Whilſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt thus reſted, whether private Believers reſted alſo upon the Seventh day, according to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſeems, that day when our Lord ſuffered was the Preparation, which we call <hi>Friday,</hi> and the Sabbath drew on or dawned, and the Women which came with him from <hi>Galilee</hi> followed after, and beheld the Sepulchre, and how his Body was laid, and returning, they had prepared Spices and Oyntments, <hi>and reſted</hi> (or, and verily they had reſted) <hi>the Sabbath day (i. e.</hi> the Seventh day Sabbath) <hi>according to the Command, (i. e.</hi> the Fourth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48100:23"/> Command in the Decalogue) <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 54, 55, 56, and <hi>the firſt day of the week they came early to the Sepulchre, Luke</hi> 24. 1. Which one Inſtance being of a Matter of Fact, witneſſed by the Holy Spirit in this Scripture, to be done after the Death of Chriſt, and to be done in obedience to the Fourth Command, by theſe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Women, who it ſeems were many, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 40, 41, 47. and <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 10. is a Proof, that all the Ten Commands were in force after the Death of Chriſt, and after his being in <hi>Paradice (i. e.</hi> in Heaven) and that his Commands were ſtill a ſtanding Rule for all to walk by; and in particular, that the Fourth Command, for keeping holy the Seventh day, and reſting upon it, was no way aboliſhed or altered by Chriſt, in his Life, or by his Death, who was now dead and buried, and yet the Seventh-day Sabbath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: And if any ſuch Doctrine for the change of the Sabbath had been preached by Chriſt, it is likely ſo great a Change would ſomewhere be recorded in one of the Evangeliſts, but no ſuch matter is there written, but the quite contrary in this Text; and if any ſuch Change had been made by Chriſt, theſe Women would have known ſomething of it, and would have changed their Practice, and kept the Firſt day, or elſe, if they knew any ſuch Change, we muſt ſuppoſe them wilfully diſobedient to ſuch new Command; which cannot be imagined.</p>
            <p>And he that will compare and conſider <hi>Mat. 28. 7, 8. Mark 16. 7. John 20. 1, 2, 3, 4. Luke</hi> 24. 1, 9, 12, 13. (where two of the Diſciples travelled to <hi>Emmaus</hi> upon the Firſt day) will eaſily conclude, that the Apoſtles (and I think I may add with little or no doubt) and all other Believers did then keep that Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, when Chriſt's Body lay in the Grave, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the good Women did. But however, that Scripture, <hi>viz. Luke</hi> 23. 56. does fully prove, that whilſt the Lord reſted in Heaven, and his Body in the Grave, upon his own inſtituted Seventh-day Sabbath, theſe Believers reſted alſo according to his Command; which Practice of theſe excellent Women, after the death of Chriſt, recorded by the Holy Spirit, has great weight to reſolve this Queſtion, <hi>Which is the true Chriſtian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath?</hi> and does prove, that whilſt the Lord reſted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his Body in the Grave, private Believers reſted alſo.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48100:23"/>
            <p>Q. 10. <hi>Whether the Seventh-day Sabbath was obſerved after the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> After his Reſurrection, what day it was that he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, or what day of the week it will be, wherein Chriſt will come again, I may not be poſitive, though from ſome circumſtances; as, the diſtance of Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> but a Sabbath days Journey from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and from the two Angels prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, That that ſame Jeſus ſhould ſo come in like manner as they ſaw him go into Heaven; and, that this was when Chriſt and his Apoſtles were aſſembled and come together, and Chriſt preached to them, and promiſed to them the Holy Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 11, 12. it is ſomewhat probable to me, that his Aſcenſion might be, and that his Coming may be upon the Seventh-day Sabbath, though ſome, from the number of Forty days, wherein he was ſeen by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 3, make ſome doubt thereof.</p>
            <p>But, by no Account I can make can I aſſign the Aſcenſion on the Firſt day; nor can I ſee why that is ſo expreſly ſaid, that Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> where Chriſt aſcended, and whence the Diſciples returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was but a Sabbath-days Journey, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 12. but becauſe it was the Sabbath day. And yet in this alſo I may not be poſitive, becauſe it is not poſitively written when it was, otherwiſe than (as above) that Chriſt and his Diſciples were then aſſembled, and Chriſt preached, and that Mountain was but a Sabbath days Journey from <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 1. 12, which was as great a length of way, by the Law of <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 29, and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 3. 4, as was commonly thought by the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> they might tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel upon a Sabbath day, which is held by divers to be about two miles, for which I know no certain Scripture. Some ſay Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> was but about a mile from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but, be the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Journey more or leſs, 'tis recorded here to be but a Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Journey from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and if this was the Sabbath day, it may be thus expreſſed to anſwer an Objection. As if our Lord, by this Walk, and his Diſciples by accompanying him, and by their return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had after his death broken the Sabbath; for, we find the <hi>Jews,</hi> during his life, watching him and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples for ſome Pretence to charge him and them with breaking the Sabbath; as we find <hi>Mat. 12. 1, 2. Mark 2. 24. Luke</hi> 6. 2. And ſo might alſo be at the ſame wrangling and objecting work upon his Aſcenſion.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48100:24"/>
            <p>But however that were (for the main point, which is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, does dot depend thereon) it is undeniably certain, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Aſcenſion of the Lord Jeſus into Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, and after the giving the Holy Spirit, <hi>Acts 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (who were ſent forth by the Holy Spirit) <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 4, and their Company, went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and after the reading of the Law and the Prophets (which were then read every Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 27.) upon the deſire of the Rulers of the Synagogue of the <hi>Jews, Paul</hi> ſtands up, and preaches Chriſt at large, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 13, to 41. and when the <hi>Jews</hi> were gone out of the Synagogue, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> beſought that theſe words might be preached to them (not the next morning, upon the Firſt day of the week, but) the next Sabbath. This Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14, 42, 44, is full, where both the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles hear the Word upon the Sabbath day, which no man can deny (and is granted by all) to be the Seventh-day Sabbath, <hi>Acts 13. 42. And the next Sabbath day came together almoſt the whole City to hear the Word of God, Acts</hi> 13. 44. So that <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and his Company, and the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> obſerved the Seventh-day Sabbath, after the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> preached Forgiveneſs of Sin, and Juſtification of all Believers by Chriſt, to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and (upon the particular requeſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, not upon the Firſt day of the week, which had been more grateful to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> (who generally dedicated the Firſt day to the adoration of the Sun, whence we ſtill corruptly call it <hi>Sunday,</hi> whereof more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) if that had been grateful to the Apoſtles, but upon the ſeventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, whereupon <hi>the Jews contradict and blaſpheme, Acts</hi> 13. 45, but many <hi>Gentiles</hi> believed, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 47, 48. ſo that here were alſo many converted to Chriſt upon the ſeventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and this in a time after the Holy Spirit was promiſed to come, and promiſed to guide the Apoſtles into all Truth, <hi>John</hi> 16. 7, 13, and after that Promiſe performed in the actual giving of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Acts 2. 4, which taught them all things, 1 John</hi> 2. 27, by which Holy Spirit <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> were ſent forth, and which Holy Spirit (as I humbly think) plainly led them to this Work, and into this Truth, <hi>and this affirmed by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Word of Truth,</hi> (as the Word is called, <hi>John</hi> 17. 17.) and this after Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſcenſion; and all this, as it ſeems to me, a plain Matter of Fact, affirmed by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48100:24"/> in the Scriptures, with which Holy Spirit the Apoſtles were now filled, <hi>Acts 2. 4. &amp; 4. 31. &amp; 6. 3, 5. &amp; 7. 55. &amp; 8. 17. &amp; 10. 44. &amp; 11. 15. &amp;</hi> 13. 52, and which ſent them forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 4, 9. Which Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit, (and the Writer or Writers of this Book of the <hi>Acts</hi>) that the Seventh day was ſtill the Sabbath day, by whoſe Inſpiration this Book (as the other Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, whereunto give heed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19) was undeniably written, I inſiſt upon, as that which no man ought to deny: And for any to pretend, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did herein Judaize, and only humour the <hi>Jews</hi> for a ſeaſon, I take it to be a meer groundleſs Surmize, (to ſay no worſe of it) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any word from the Scriptures for ſuch Conceit.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; the ſame Holy Spirit doth further witneſs, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not only keep the ſeventh-day Sabbath once or twice, or now and then after Chriſt's death, but continually; for, at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> (where was a Synagogue of the <hi>Jews) Paul,</hi> as his Manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 2, 3. (or, <hi>preached to them</hi> being the ſame Greek word with that much (as I think) diſtorted place, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7, where the ſame word is rendered <hi>preached to them.</hi>) It was <hi>Paul</hi>'s conſtant Uſe, Manner, and Cuſtom to preach Chriſt upon the ſeventh-day Sabbath: And this alſo is a Matter of Fact which no Chriſtian man can deny; and 'tis remarkable, that we have the ſame certain Evidence that it was the Cuſtom of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17. 2. (and this alſo after Chriſt's Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as before) that we have of Chriſt's keeping the Sabbath, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16, there being in thoſe two Scriptures the like Greek Phraſe for both; and he that denies <hi>Paul</hi> (in his meaſure) his continual keeping of the Sabbath after the Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, and after his being declared the Son of God with Power, and after the ſolemn giving of the Holy Spirit, and the whole Work of Man's Redemption by Chriſt, abſolutely finiſhed, muſt deny this expreſs Scripture, (which is hard for any Chriſtian deliberately to do) and may with like reaſon deny almoſt any thing for which we have full Authority from the Word.</p>
            <p>That a very contrary Cuſtom was afterwards introduced into many Churches, I think, we may ſay is evident, a Cuſtom of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving another day, <hi>viz.</hi> the Firſt day inſtead of the Seventh day, which has been (as it is) maintained with great Authority, and doth prove a Plant impoſſible for Man to pluck up, without a full Teſtimony of the Word and Holy Spirit, eſpecially being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48100:25"/> ſupported, as it is, by ſuch mighty men, dead and alive, as have written for it, who are oppoſed only by a few weak perſons. 'Tis plain, that <hi>Paul</hi> preached in the Synagogue every Sabbath (<hi>i. e.</hi> every ſeventh-day Sabbath; for all Writers agree, that the Sabbath which the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved was the ſeventh day) and that he perſwaded <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> So that we have here Scripture-Inſtances of Miniſters, and of Believers in Chriſt after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcenſion, and after the pouring out the Holy Spirit, by deliberate choice keeping the ſeventh-day Sabbath, in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue or Church, where they came together for their publick Worſhip, and the Miniſters there preaching <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And, who can conſiderately think, that the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit miſnamed the Sabbath, and calls the Seventh day the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, if it were changed to the Firſt day?</p>
            <p>And, if I had offered no more (than thoſe few Lines in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Tenth Queſtion) in my weak Judgment, this were ſufficient to anſwer all that I know is written for the Firſt day; and I have read much about it, and this conſiſting of Matters of Fact, has no need of being argued; ſearch the Scriptures, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11, and ſee if theſe things be ſo, or no.</p>
            <p>Q. 11. <hi>Whether the Holy Spirit calls the Seventh day the Sabbath (and no other day of the week) both in the Old and in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer affirmatively, as appears in the Anſwer to the former Queſtions, and in particular, That the Seventh day has the name of the Sabbath, and was kept as the Sabbath, after the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and after the pouring out of the Holy Spirit; appears in the Anſwer to the Tenth Queſtion.</p>
            <p>And the Advocates for the Firſt day do not pretend, that the Firſt day is any where in the Scriptures called the Sabbath; as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> a very learned Writer for the Firſt day, doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Print.</p>
            <p>Nor has any man yet ſhewn any Word or Command from God to obſerve it: Nor are there two weekly days ſet apart by God for holy Worſhip; and ſo I think this Eleventh Queſtion needs no farther Labour.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:48100:25"/>
            <p>Objections which are made in this Caſe (although they ſeem to me to ariſe moſtly from Conjectures at the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Expreſſions in the Word, which ſeem<note place="margin">Objections and Anſwers.</note> to others to have no ſuch ſence) now come to be conſidered, it being reaſonable, that the Evidence of the other ſide be heard alſo, that the Reader may make a right Judgment thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The firſt Objection which I conſider, is that raiſed from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which Reſurrection ſome think convenient ſhould be celebrated by a particular weekly day, and the rather (as one ſays) becauſe it is poſſible the Seventh day was changed: Others more frankly ſay it was changed, but they are not ſure, whether by Chriſt during his Life, or by him after his Reſurrection; or, whether by his Apoſtles, or any of them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Aſcenſion; or when, or where, or by whom; any of theſe Uncertainties they do not yet reſolve us, and I think we are ſure (and ſome of the other ſide do acknowledge) that no ſuch Change is recorded in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>But however, they ſuppoſe it for the Honour of Chriſt, that one day in a week be ſet apart to commemorate his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They do ſuppoſe this; Our Law, and all Mankind, do admit, that there is as much reaſon for thoſe things that have no Exiſtence, (<hi>i. e.</hi> which are not) as there is for thoſe things which do not appear. If once Suppoſitions be allowed inſtead of Evidence and Proof, any man of Parts and Credit may introduce great Abſurdities.</p>
            <p>When it can be truly ſaid, that the Lord has no where in his Word enjoyn'd the obſervation of the Firſt day, that they can ſhew, or (after the ſtricteſt ſearch) that we can find, What Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour has any man to obſerve it?</p>
            <p>And when it can be truly ſaid, that the Lord has no where in his Word repealed the Fourth Command, nor altered the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, or any way blotted it out of his Law, (by which Law we are to walk, and by which we are to be judged) that they can ſhew, or we can find, how can we preſume to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it?</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48100:26"/>
            <p>Or, if the Lord had any where in his Word transferred Power to any Man or Men, to invent a new way of honouring Chriſt, and to ſet apart a new day to commemorate his Reſurrection, this were ſomething; but where is there any ſuch Power recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Scriptures, to be given to any Man or Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever?</p>
            <p>And if there be no ſuch new Command given by Chriſt, to keep the Firſt day, and no ſuch Authority given by him to any perſons whatſoever, to alter the Seventh day, who then ſhall ſet Bounds to ſuch as once undertake of their own Heads, (without any Commiſſion from Chriſt) to vary from, and to add to the Commands of Chriſt? However ſpecious and plauſible the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences be, can any think it is for the Honour of Chriſt, or the Reſurrection, that Men (of their own minds) ſhould take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and boldneſs to add to, or to alter any of his Commands? Why may not others command us to kneel to the conſecrated Bread, and pretend (as many do) that it is for the Honour of Chriſt? And, why may not one as well maintain the yearly Obſervation of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> in memory of his Birth, and of <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in memory of his Paſſion, and of <hi>Eaſter</hi> in memory of his Reſurrection, and of <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> in memory of his Aſcenſion, and of Altars and Adoration towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and that ſtanding, and not kneeling, in expectation of his ſecond Coming (which ſome pretend to gueſs may be from the <hi>Eaſt</hi>) as well as a new weekly Sabbath? All which Conceits, and many other ſuch-like, do pretend to be for the Honour of Chriſt, and are ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſeem to intend and mean very well. When any perſons whatſoever ſhall, with pretended good Intentions, aſſume an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their own heads, to add to the Word of God, or any way to alter it, in a tittle; in comes therewith not only the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tides of <hi>Chriſtmas, &amp;c.</hi> (as they call them) but the whole <hi>Romiſh</hi> Kalendar of Saints, and all their Maſs and Monkery, which have ſpecious Pretences, and cannot be reſiſted, if the Churches corrupted, or the pureſt Churches, be once admitted to have ſuch a Power; for, if the Church, or any part thereof, may invent and alter one day of the week, and the World of Chriſtians be thereby concluded, and bound to obſerve ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, I know no Bolts or Locks ſtrong enough for ſuch a Door, to keep it from letting in upon the Churches of Chriſt, whatſoever pleaſeth thoſe in Power, in any part of the World, whether it do concern God's immediate ſolemn Worſhip, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48100:26"/> Matters of Doctrine, Diſcipline, or Converſation: Men may as well take the other ſix, as one day, (as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> for many weeks in the year do) and they may as well make any other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, if ſuch Gapps be laid open, and by the like reaſon lay as great Burthens upon the Chriſtian Churches as were upon the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, or as are now upon the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> ſuch as are utterly inconſiſtent with all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Worſhip, and all true Liberty, wherein Chriſt, by his Word, has made his Churches free, in which Liberty we are to ſtand faſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1, which Liberty eminently conſiſts in a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not only from the Ceremonial Laws of old, contained in Ordinances which are laid aſide by Chriſt, which Liberty is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by him; but alſo in a Liberty not to be entangled with a new Yoke of Mens Devices and Inventions, whereof there is no end: Chriſt has left Laws enough for the well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> governing of his Churches, to which Laws of his if we yield entire ſubjection, we have certainly no need farther to trouble our ſelves; and whilſt no man has yet ſhewn us from the Scriptures any Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Firſt day, nor any Alteration of the Seventh, after One thouſand Six hundred and Ninety years elapſed, I do not now expect it; for, places have been already ſearched by many Writers, and not being yet found, I think we may conclude, that Change never will be found.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> This change of the Seventh day to the Firſt, ſome have endeavoured to find in <hi>John</hi> 20. 19, 26. In the 19th Verſe it is ſaid, That <hi>the ſame day at Evening (viz.</hi> the Evening after his Reſurrection) <hi>being the Firſt day of the week, when the Doors were ſhut, Jeſus ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto them; (viz.</hi> to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>Peace unto you.</hi> Whence ſome gather, becauſe Chriſt roſe upon the Firſt day, and appeared to the Diſciples in the Evening, therefore we muſt obſerve the Firſt day. And in the 26th Verſe it is ſaid, <hi>And after eight days (his Diſciples within, and</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas <hi>with them) came Jeſus (the doors being ſhut) and ſtood in the midst, and ſaid, Peace unto you.</hi> Now (ſay ſome) <hi>after eight days</hi> ſignifieth here the Eighth day from the Reſurrection, counting the day wherein Chriſt roſe for one; as we call thoſe third days Agues which have but one days intermiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Tertians,</hi> and thoſe Agues which have but two days intermiſſion <hi>Quartans;</hi> and ſo the Diſciples (having met on the Reſurrection day) met again that day Sevennight.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48100:27"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. All which if we do admit, here is no Inſtitution of the Firſt day, nor any pretence of laying aſide or altering the Seventh; which I take to be an Anſwer ſufficient to all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that I ever met with upon this Queſtion, (<hi>viz. The Firſt day has no Word-Inſtitution.</hi>)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But more particularly the Firſt day, <hi>John</hi> 20. 19, 26, is underſtood by Expoſitors to be the ſame day mentioned in <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 13, 29, where two Diſciples travelled to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and Chriſt with them, which <hi>Emmaus</hi> was about ſeven miles and an half (according to our computation from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and ſo more than a Sabbath-days Journey, which (they ſay) was about two miles. So then theſe two Diſciples did not obſerve the Firſt day the day of the Reſurrection, nor aſſemble to worſhip nor reſt upon it, but travelled (as far as does appear to us) about their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſions, upon the ſame day that Chriſt roſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 1, 13. and Chriſt travelled with them alſo upon the ſame day; and how that day was obſerved by him or them, as a day of Reſt and Travel too, that is, to journey and to reſt at the ſame time, is very hard for me to conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> And as to that in <hi>John</hi> 20. 26, where Jeſus is ſaid to come again after eight days, when the Diſciples were within with <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> It is not ſaid, they were aſſembled about any Religious Worſhip, whatſoever is affirmed of that nature, is meerly gueſſed; it's ſaid only, that <hi>they were within with</hi> Thomas <hi>with them,</hi> it's probable the Perſecution againſt them being then hot, upon the crucifying of our Lord, they lay concealed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and locked the Doors, and were ſeldom abroad, and at that time were certainly within, when Chriſt miraculouſly ſtood in the midſt, and appeared to them. But then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this ſecond appearing was upon the Firſt day of the week, is (<hi>gratis dictum</hi>) freely ſaid, but is not there writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; the Text ſays, It was <hi>after eight days;</hi> ſay theſe Objectors, It was the Eighth day, including the former Firſt day, that is, the day ſevennight after his Reſurrection. So the Text ſays, it was <hi>after eight days;</hi> ſay they, 'Twas after ſix or ſeven days; which ſeems to me impoſſible; for, let any man tell eight upon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48100:27"/> his Fingers, and if he do not find that day after eight days to be <hi>Monday</hi> or <hi>Tueſday,</hi> (as we now call the days) then I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reckon; and this being an account eaſie to be caſt up, I leave it. But, for men to ſay, that after Eight is after Seven or Six days, and muſt be ſo underſtood, becauſe ſome would fain have it ſo, and thereupon to build this Change, ſeems to me contrary to all Sence, and further Anſwer to this I think needleſs.</p>
            <p>And as to that which they offer from <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 31, I find divers learned Expoſitors underſtand, that <hi>Mark</hi> reckons the time from his firſt being betrayed and apprehended, and that <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks only of the time that he lay in the Grave, which was but part of three days; other Anſwers are given, but this part of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſeems not to be over-ingenious, for that thoſe who make it, ſeem to go about to ſhake the day of his Reſurrection (if they could) rather than want ſome Pretence for the Firſt day weekly: But, however this, or that in <hi>John</hi> 20, be underſtood, yet here is no Inſtitution of the Firſt day, nothing of the Worſhip the Diſciples were met about, either the one or the other of theſe Days, and conſequently little Colour for ſuch a Conceit. And as to the Reſurrection, it is ſo fully proved by many Eye-witneſſes throughout the New Teſtament, as I need to add no more to that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Some fancy the day which Chriſt ſays to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that their Father <hi>Abraham rejoyced to ſee, and ſaw, and was glad, John</hi> 8. 56, was the day of the Reſurrection, and therefore the Firſt day of the week (as the day of the Reſurrection) muſt be for ever kept holy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Which day, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw, others think, referrs to the day of his Incarnation, and thence inferr the Obſervation of <hi>Chriſtmas-day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which Objection from <hi>John</hi> 8. 56, ſome Anſwer may be from <hi>John</hi> 9. 4, 5, where Chriſt ſays to his Diſciples, <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me, whileſt it is day, the night cometh, when no man can work.</hi> Where (<hi>day</hi>) referrs to the time of Chriſt's Life and publick Miniſtry, and ſhews the day of Chriſt <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyced to ſee, <hi>John</hi> 8. 56, to be the time of Chriſt's preaching the Goſpel, which was, in part, whilſt Chriſt's Life in this World laſted; and ſo <hi>John</hi> 9. 4, is explained <hi>John 9. 5, (As long as I am in the World.</hi>)</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:48100:28"/>
            <p>Their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> joyfully believed the Promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo by Faith foreſaw Chriſt's Coming, and was glad: The <hi>Jews</hi> gloried much in this, that they had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father; <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father by Faith foreſaw Chriſt's Coming into the World, his preaching the Goſpel, his dying upon the Croſs; <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw this by Faith in the Promiſe which was made to him, That <hi>in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 12. 3, &amp; 22. 18, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw this in the Type of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s being offered, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17, 18, 19. This <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw by the Light of Divine Revelation; he ſaw Chriſt's coming in the Fleſh, his dying for Sinners, typified by the Ram ſacrificed inſtead of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and typified by other Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and he ſaw by Faith (upon the coming of Chriſt) the publication of the Goſpel of Chriſt to the whole World, by which means all the Nations of the Earth, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are become bleſſed in his Seed; <hi>and</hi> Abraham <hi>was glad with the joy of Faith,</hi> which gives the Soul a clear view of a certain promiſed Bleſſing and Good, at a diſtance, as if it were preſent. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1, 13, and ſo I think <hi>John</hi> 8. 56, evidently referrs to thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Times which <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith in the Promiſe, ſaw afar off: But that day which Chriſt ſays <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw, being mentioned as a day in general, ſome would fain hook in as one day in every week, and ſo by a narrow underſtanding of what <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw by Faith, would reſtrain it only to a particular day of the week by their Conjecture.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now, that the Stone which the Builders rejected, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22, is meant of Chriſt, is agreed; as alſo, that Chriſt is the Son of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 4, and that he is declared to be the Son of God with Power, by his riſing from the Dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. But the day mentioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24, I take (as before) to be the time of preaching and promulgating the Goſpel of Chriſt; and the Reſurrection of Chriſt did plainly declare him to be God, the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48100:28"/> true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and Saviour of all that believe in him. But, to graft upon theſe places any thing of an inſtitution of a weekly new Sabbath, or of repealing the Seventh day, I take to be a meer Conjecture, and has no Foundation but in mens Fancies.</p>
            <p>Others gueſs the day mentioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24, to be the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation day, either of which Conceits, if I could but find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where written in the Scriptures, I hope I ſhould believe; but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding none of theſe there written, to me they do but ſeem to prove the Shifts and Windlaces ſome are driven to uſe, to patch up ſuch Conceits.

            <p>The Goſpel-day before mentioned is a day of glad Tydings, for, <hi>the promiſe which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fulfilled in Chriſt, Acts</hi> 13. 32, 33, the glad Tydings of our Deliverance from Sin and Hell, by the ſatisfaction made to the Juſtice of God by the Merits and perfect Obedience of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>And they gueſs the breaking of Bread there, was the Lord's Supper, which, they gueſs, the Diſciples did there once come together to do upon the Firſt day of the week, and therefore, they gueſs, did upon the Firſt day of every week then and ever after; and <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching to them then, they gueſs, was becauſe the Seventh day was changed to the Firſt day, but when, where, or by whom, they ſhew us not, but generally acknowledge to be no where found in the Scriptures; only we muſt take their word for it, which, without a word from the Lord, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelf to do.</p>

            <p>But why the coming together of the Diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 7, might not be, as Friends commonly do, (when a Miniſter or any other ſpecial Acquaintance intends to take a Journey in the morning) to ſupp with him over-night, I ſee no ſubſtantial Reaſon; which is a Sence obvious to common Underſtandings, as it ſeems, without Violence: Whereas the haling of this Text, to make a new ſtanding Law for the alteration of the Fourth Command, and for the ſetting up another day of the week, to be perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved as a weekly Sabbath by all the World, ſeems all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and a meer force upon the Text. Nor does the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Inſtitution of the Lord's Supper need any Art to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; for, it is plainly and fully given and eſtabliſhed <hi>Mat. 26. 26, 27, 28, Mark 14. 22, 23, 24, Luke</hi> 22. 17, 18, 19, 20, which Inſtitution was alſo obſerved by the Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25. And this I add to avoid Slanders, which, unleſs God awe ſome men by his Word, I expect upon every point.</p>
            <p>And upon this place, in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7, and upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, (which come to be conſidered in the next Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) the three Scriptures, upon which the great, pious, and learned Aſſembly in the 21ſt Chapter of <hi>Conf. parag.</hi> 7, do, as I underſtand them, principally build their Opinion for the Firſt day.—For the other Texts cited by them, as <hi>Exod. 20, 8, 10, 11, Iſa. 56. 2, 4, 6, 7, Gen. 2. 2, 3, Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18, ſeem to be againſt it; but what is ſaid in that Paragraph, That God in his Word, by a poſitive, moral, and perpetual Commandment, binds all men in all Ages, and hath particularly appointed One day in Seven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, I think is right and true; but for the changing that day to the Firſt day of the week, I find not.</p>
            <p>It may be remembred, the Greek word (<hi>Mia</hi>) ſignifies <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>(Eis, Mia, En)</hi> is rendered not the <hi>Firſt,</hi> but <hi>One,</hi> in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the New Teſtament (as I take it) about an hundred times; and if it were ſo rendered here, <hi>One</hi> (day) of the week,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48100:31"/> it would ſomewhat abate this Objection; but I admit, that One day probably was the Firſt day.</p>
            <p>And reading this Text, according to our Tranſlation, (the Firſt day of the week) I think this is certain, from that place, that <hi>Paul preached to the Diſciples;</hi> which probably was till the Evening after the Seventh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> day Sabbath, and continued his Speech till midnight, <hi>v.</hi> 7, and till break of day, <hi>v.</hi> 11, being ready to depart in the morning (which probably was the morning) of the Firſt day, and then departed, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 13.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Paul</hi> departed and travelled, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 13, then this alſo will overthrow the Objection from this place, for Travelling and Sabbatizing do not well agree together, (excepting Caſes of Neceſſity or Mercy, which Mercy is alſo of ſome Neceſſity.) Which I think ſufficient Anſwer to this Objection.</p>
            <p>And however, I do ſay, that here is not one word of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Firſt day; no ſuch thing as any Command to obſerve it; no ſuch thing as altering the Seventh day: And where the plain Light of the Word doth not go before us, it is our Wiſdom (as I think) to ſit ſtill and be ſilent.</p>

And when this Collection for the Saints was to be made, I cannot tell, if it were to be upon one day of the week yearly, if that Scripture will bear that ſence, (but of yearly Collections nothing is there that I know expreſly written.)

And if it be an Order to <hi>lay aſide</hi> upon the Firſt day of the week, as the Objectors would have it, 'tis plainly an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to caſt up their Accounts that day, and to tell their Moneys they have got, and to reckon how much their Stock is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and what can be reaſonably ſpared from their neceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and deducting all Charges, which every perſon muſt well conſider that would diſcreetly lay aſide, <hi>as God hath proſpered him;</hi> which (as I ſaid) as I never knew or heard of any man that did upon the firſt day of the week, ſo I think the Advocates for the Firſt day will hardly allow, as proper Work for a Sabbath, nor yet is very conſiſtent with an holy Reſt upon that day, which yet ſuch muſt do, for ought I know, and more, who make that a general Order, ſuch ſtrange Inconveniencies do ariſe when the Scriptures are ſtrained beyond the plain meaning of them. The Order is, not to give to charitable uſes, or to diſtribute to the Poor that day, but that every one <hi>lay by him in ſtore;</hi> which certainly muſt be upon caſting up their Accounts; but whatever be the meaning of that place, as to Accounts on that day, the main drift of it is, that <hi>every one lay by him in ſtore, as God</hi> had <hi>proſpered him,</hi> that there might be a Stock ready to diſtribute to the Poor Saints as their Neceſſities required, which (in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, ſometime or other) ſerious underſtanding Chriſtians, I think, do or ought. But, what one word is there in this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2, for repealing, altering, or changing the Sabbath, or for aſſembling of the Churches, or for aſſembling any one particular Church, or for performing any manner of Worſhip upon this day?

John <hi>was in the Iſle</hi> Patmos, <hi>for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, and was in the Spirit upon the Lords day, (Gr.</hi> En te Kuriake emera) <hi>and heard behind him a great voice, as of a Trumpet, ſaying, I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion is, What day this was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some have thought this to be a yearly day, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Birth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſome think was in <hi>December,</hi> and therefore we in <hi>England,</hi> and a few others, who obſerve the old Style, keep the 25th of <hi>December;</hi> and the reſt of the Chriſtian and Romiſh World, in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> part of it, who obſerve any day upon that account, keep the 15th day of <hi>December, (i. e.</hi> ten days ſooner than we) in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it.</p>
            <p>And ſome thought the day of Chriſt's Birth was in <hi>September;</hi> and I find in <hi>Gregory's Poſthuma, p.</hi> 164, that the day of Chriſt's Nativity was not in uſe till 532 years after: He ſays, the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians, Aethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> hold, he was born the Sixth of <hi>January;</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> that he was born in <hi>April; Beroaldus,</hi> in <hi>October; Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Calviſius,</hi> that 'twas in <hi>September; Hoſpinian,</hi> that Chriſtians did not celebrate the 25th of <hi>December</hi> (as to Chriſt then born) but to make amends for the <hi>Satur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And if the Church here obſerve the 25th, that is the right day here, becauſe the Church here ſays it. By which large Rule other Churches may as well obſerve any day they pleaſe, but no one day at all being appointed (that I ever read of) in the Scripture, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating the Nativity of our Lord: I know no good ground for obſerving any day upon that account.</p>

Some think the Lord's day in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, is a yearly day in Commemoration of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, which is commonly kept upon <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> which Reſurrection-day <hi>John</hi> and his Diſciples obſerved (if the Hiſtory be true) upon the Fourteenth Day of the Firſt Month, upon whatever day of the week it fell, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Account.</p>

And ſome think the Lord's day in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, to be that Great Providential day in the latter days, when Chriſt will appear to plead the Cauſe of his Lordly Authority and Kingly Power, which (they think) <hi>John</hi> might ſee in that Viſion.

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 4. Some think the Lord's day in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, to be a Weekly day; of which ſort ſome have thought it to be the Firſt day of the week, which we commonly call <hi>Sunday,</hi> for which they alledge Eccleſiaſtical Tradition. Others think, if it be a Weekly day, that it is the ſeventh day of the week, for which they alledge divers Scriptures, and which is to be preferred in ſuch Caſes, (which God has thought fit to leave ſo undetermin'd as this in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.) either Tradition (if Tradition were for it) or the Scriptures collated with <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, is much of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion between theſe two.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the firſt Opinion, That the day in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, was an Anniverſary day, obſerved by <hi>John</hi> in remembrance of the Incarnation; or that it was an Anniverſary day obſerved by him in remembrance of the Reſurrection; I may ſay as in the caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s dead Body, <hi>Deut. 34. 6, No man knoweth of his Sepulchre to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48100:33"/> this day;</hi> ſo I ſay here, the Lord has no where in his Word cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly revealed what day this was, but has (as it ſeems to me, if we may be allowed humbly ſo to write) purpoſely hidden it; and if we may humbly enquire into the reaſon of that hiding it, the notorious Idolatries, Debaucheries, Uncleanneſſes, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and great Wickedneſſes (to which God in his Word gives no Countenance) accompanying its obſervation, may ſomewhat reſolve us. As 'tis generally thought, the reaſon why the Lord did not make known where be buried <hi>Moſes,</hi> was, that his Body or Sepulchre might not be to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> an occaſion of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and conſequently of all other Wickedneſs, as it was in the caſe of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 4, 5, 6, 7, which <hi>Moſes</hi> burnt, powdered, and ſtrewed upon the Water, and ſo made it impoſſible ever to be found, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>But the main doubt from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, is, Whether it be a Weekly day, and what day of the week it is.</p>
            <p>One of the great Writers for the Firſt day ſays, There is an Univerſal Teſtimony for its obſervation for Sixteen hundred years together; to which, if that Account were true, (which I think will appear after in this Book to be miſtaken) I anſwer, That from <hi>Lamech, Gen.</hi> 4. 19, to the Prophet <hi>Malachi, Mal.</hi> 2. 14, 15, which (as ſome compute) was about 2480 years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Polygamy, or the having many Wives, was frequently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by ſome eminent in the Church at that time, and was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs held lawful by them, for we cannot charitably ſuppoſe they commonly and openly lived in groſs Sins, and practiſed what they condemned in their Judgments as ſinful, and yet there were Laws in the Word at that time (as we now find) expreſly againſt it, as <hi>Gen. 2. 23, 24, The man and his Wife ſhall be one fleſh,</hi> and (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Lamech) Thou ſhalt not take a Wife to her Siſter during her life, Lev.</hi> 18. 18, for that two Wives at once for one man, they two would be to one another as two Siſters; and yet the having more Wives than one was for a long time practiſed, and little taken notice of (if at all) by the Prophets, who ſharply repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved other Sins of that People, till the time of <hi>Malachi,</hi> which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice is fully refuted by our Lord, upon occaſion of his rightly ſtating the Caſe of putting away a Wife, <hi>Mat. 19. 3, 4, 5, 6, Mark 10. 7, 8, They two (viz.</hi> the Man and his Wife, not they three, four, or five) <hi>ſhall be one fleſh;</hi> and by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 16, Eph.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48100:33"/>
            <p>And ſo the Feaſt of <hi>Booths</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8. 17, was not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as ſome compute from <hi>Joſhua</hi> to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> which was for about One thouſand years.</p>
            <p>And for how many years the Seventh day Sabbath was before and under the Captivity turned into a Market-day, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 15, to 21, I know not, but 'tis there written, that their Fathers mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketting upon the Sabbath, occaſioned the Captivity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under their oppreſſing Perſecutors, was there particularly reproved for prophaning the Sabbath by <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> as I ſhall ſhew more under the twelfth Queſtion. So that Commands may be broken, and great and plain Duties may be long and generally omitted in the Churches, and great Faults committed, and yet Commands are ſtill Commands, and Duties continue Duties, and Sins are ſtill Tranſgreſſions of the Law; and as ſoon as God does give us the knowledge of any Duty, we ought to ſet about it; and when He diſcovers to us any Sin, we ſhould bewail it, and turn from it.</p>
            <p>And, in Truth, the longer the obſervation of the Seventh day has been diſcontinued, if it had been for Sixteen hundred years together, (which Reckoning I think you may hereafter find di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed) the louder the Lord in the Fourth Command doth call upon us to return to the Law and to the Teſtimony, the length of time wherein ſome Churches have given a Bill of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce to the Sabbath, being a ſtrong Argument to continue no longer in obſervance of the Firſt day, to which we never were married (that I find) by the Lord.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſing the Churches had all for a long time obſerved the Firſt day, and by Tradition taken it for the Lord's day, if they were long miſtaken, muſt they therefore perſiſt in that wrong Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and never be reclaimed? And, muſt no man dare, under pain and peril of many Reproaches and other Perſecutions and Ruin in this World (ſo far as Angry men can do it) pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, or ſpeak or write a Word for it? For, all the Cry about the length of time (if it were true) has only this Force; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have been out of our way for a long time, therefore let no man preſume or think to put us in our way again, which is no good Arguing upon the Road, nor in other Caſes, and why in this?</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48100:34"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 5. From <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, it is plain, That <hi>John was in the Iſland</hi> Patmos, <hi>and was there in the Spirit, (i. e.</hi> in an Extaſie and Rapture of Mind) wherein the Underſtanding is raiſed and fixed in Contemplation of Divine things, which were afterwards to come to paſs in the Churches and the World: Which alſo, in part, was the caſe of <hi>Peter, Acts 10. 10, about the ſixth hour,</hi> but whether on the Sabbath I know not; and of <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 2, but whether on the Sabbath I know not; and often of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and <hi>John</hi> being <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> was on the Lord's day. Now, to find out which day of the week this was (if it were a weekly day which is not written) I ſhall offer the beſt Evidence I can from the Word, Opinions in ſuch undetermined Caſes being only Conjectures, which I heartily ſubmit to the Word and better Judgments, who are awed by the Word.</p>
            <p>From the Text or Context we find nothing very conſiderable on either ſide, that I know, and therefore to find out what day this is, ſhall collate other Scriptures; for, whatſoever is neceſſary to be known, and not expreſſed in one Text, is found in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for, the Word of God is certainly compleat as to all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths. I find a great deficiency in my own Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Memory, but nothing wanting in the Scriptures, and whoſoever is once poiſoned with Conceits that the Scriptures are defective, I do not wonder if ſuch run to <hi>any thing</hi> that is upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: For, as the Scriptures are given by Inſpiration of God, ſo they are able to <hi>make us wiſe to Salvation, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16, 17. And he that thinks this Scripture, or any other Scripture, falſe, will be no Rule to me.</p>
            <p>And here I may firſt recollect what was offered on the Third Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after the Creation the Seventh-day Sabbath was inſtituted by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by him was bleſſed and ſanctified, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, and thence thus reaſon:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> That day which the Lord bleſſed and ſanctified, is the Lord's day, but the Seventh day of the week is that day which he bleſſed and ſanctified, therefore the Seventh day is the Lord's day.</p>
            <p>That the Lord bleſſed and ſanctified the Seventh day, (and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he that bleſſed it was the Lord Chriſt) and that the Seventh day is the day he bleſſed and ſanctified, are expreſly proved by <hi>Gen.</hi> 2 2, 3, 4, and in the firſt, ſecond, and third Queſtions.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48100:34"/>
            <p>And if it be ſo, it ſeems to follow ſomewhat ſtrongly, that then the Seventh day is the Lord's day. Now, although all the days of the week are the Lord's, (that is) 'twas he that made that diviſion of Time into Seven days, and there ſtayed, and every day is his; yet he having peculiarly bleſſed, ſanctified, and called the Seventh day his day, and reſted upon it, and ſet it apart for Man to reſt on; and He having no where (that I can yet find in his Word) ſaid any ſuch thing of the Firſt day, or of any other day of the week, but only of the Seventh, I dare not ſpeak or think contrary to his expreſs Command and Word, and the Seventh day ſeems to me only to be, and to be by Him cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Lord's day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Scripture to prove, that the Seventh-day Sabbath is the Lord's day, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10, where the Seventh day is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed to be the Sabbath of the Lord, that is, the Seventh day is the Lord's Sabbath day, or the Lord's day of Reſt, or the Lord's day; and the like is in <hi>Deut. 5. 14, The Seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that which is the Lord's Sabbath day, I ſhould think, cannot well be denied to be the Lord's day, and it being his Sabbath day, does not make it ceaſe to be a day, or ceaſe to be his day; and if it be his day, then 'tis the Lord's day.</p>
            <p>Or, we may reaſon thus; That day which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kept holy is the Lord's day, but the Seventh day is that day which the Lord commanded to be kept holy, therefore the Seventh day is the Lord's day.</p>
            <p>Now, that the Seventh day is that day which the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be kept holy, appears from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 10, and <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 12, 14, 15. The latter end of that 15th Verſe is very cogent, <hi>For thus hath the Lord commanded thee to do;</hi> or, to make that day the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>3. Another Scripture to prove the Seventh day to be the Lord's day, is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 13, where the Sabbath is called <hi>the Lord's Holy-day,</hi> and <hi>the Holy of the Lord.</hi> I think no Writer has yet doubted, that the Sabbath there ſpoken of was the Seventh-day Sabbath then, and ſtill, obſerved by the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and it cannot be the leſs his day becauſe it is his Holy-day.</p>
            <p>And if it be His day, then it is the Lord's day; and that which He calls his day, and ſays is his day, is certainly his day, and we ought to believe and acknowledge it to be his day. In
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48100:35"/> which plain Arguments, I think, there is ſome ſtrength, though weakly expreſſed.</p>
            <p>4. Another Argument I take from <hi>Mat. 12. 8, For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day.</hi> And the like <hi>Mark 2. 28, The Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> And the like in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 5, Chriſt ſaith to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> That <hi>the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath:</hi> (Which places alſo farther prove Chriſt's Deity.)</p>
            <p>That the Sabbath there in <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſpoken of is the Seventh day Sabbath, I think, is agreed by all Expoſitors, and appears in thoſe Chapters to be the Sabbath which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then obſerved, which was then, and is ſtill, the Seventh day of the week: And we find in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 5, that the Exception was taken by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> as if Chriſt's Diſciples, by plucking Ears of Corn and eating them, had done that which was not lawful to be done on the Sabbath day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 1, 2. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did not object againſt Chriſt as breaking <hi>Sunday, (i. e.</hi> the Firſt day.) And ſo it muſt needs be the Seventh-day Sabbath that this Debate between the Lord and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> was about. And the ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 24, 28, and of <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 2, 3, 5, in which Scriptures it was the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath</hi> that was in queſtion. And that the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> who is there ſaid to be <hi>Lord of the Sabbath day,</hi> is Chriſt, I think alſo certain, for that our Saviour uſeth this term of <hi>Son of Man</hi> about ſixty times in the Goſpel, and always of himſelf, and I think never with reference to any other man. And Chriſt is called the <hi>Son of Man</hi> by <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1. 13, (but three Verſes from <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10.) from whence this main Objection is taken: And <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14, Chriſt is again called <hi>the Son of Man;</hi> ſo that <hi>the Son of Man</hi> in <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> (who writ the <hi>Revelation</hi>) is the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who is <hi>Lord of the Sabbath day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe who would interpret <hi>the Son of Man</hi> in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> to be ordinary Men, and ſo give ordinary men a Lordſhip over a Moral Law, as no ſuch thing is written, ſo I take that Interpretation to be wholly unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and exploded by all ſound Expoſitors, and would give Men a Lordſhip over the Moral Laws, which would be a very looſe Interpretation.</p>
            <p>And I take it to be plain, that by <hi>the Son of Man</hi> in <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> is meant the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48100:35"/>
            <p>Then ſuppoſing the Sabbath mentioned by <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> to be the Seventh-day weekly Sabbath, and <hi>the Son of Man</hi> mentioned by <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which day then (if the Scriptures may be Judge) is the true Lord's day?</p>
            <p>Whence I may thus reaſon; That day whereof Chriſt the <hi>Son of Man</hi> is Lord, is the Lord's day, but the Seventh-day Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is that day whereof Chriſt the <hi>Son of Man is Lord,</hi> therefore the ſeventh-day Sabbath is the Lord's day. And if the Scriptures may and muſt reſolve the Caſe, and the ſeventh day be the Lord's day, ſure then there is an end of this Objection.</p>
            <p>I know ſome put a very wrong Gloſs (as I think) upon theſe three plain Texts of <hi>Mat. 12. 8, Mark 2. 28, Luke</hi> 6. 5, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the Son of Man's being Lord of the Sabbath, imports, that Chriſt the Son of Man hath power to change the Sabbath; by which Gloſs they do acknowledge, that <hi>the Son of Man</hi> there is Chriſt, and that by the Sabbath in thoſe Texts is meant the Seventh-day Sabbath, and that Chriſt is Lord of the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath, (which alſo farther proves Chriſt to be <hi>Jehovah</hi>) which no Chriſtian man can deny; but, that there was any Thought of changing it, there is not a tittle written: And if Chriſt's words had had that meaning, and the <hi>Jews</hi> (to whom he ſpake) had ſo underſtood him, they would ſurely have taken greater Offence at ſuch Doctrine, whereof there is not a word in thoſe Texts; where the Caſe was this in ſhort.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews,</hi> by miſunderſtanding the true meaning of the Fourth Command, thought Chriſt broke that Law by working miraculous Cures on the Seventh-day, and that his Diſciples broke it, by plucking and rubbing Ears of Corn for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Food upon the Sabbath day: This Miſtake of the <hi>Jews</hi> Chriſt (who gave the Sabbath, and who was and is Lord of it, and ſo beſt underſtood the true ſcope and meaning of the Law which he himſelf gave) reproves and rectifies, by a clear Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that Law.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 12. 1, 2, and <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 23, 24, 25, took exception againſt Chriſt's Diſciples, for plucking Ears of Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as doing that upon the Sabbath which was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Chriſt referrs them to what they read about <hi>David</hi>'s eating Shew-bread, which was only lawful for Prieſts, but, in caſe of neceſſity, was lawful for <hi>David</hi> to do, <hi>v.</hi> 4. And Chriſt, for farther anſwer, referrs them to the Caſe of the Prieſts in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48100:36"/> Temple, who upon the Sabbath day did divers acts of much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Labour, as offering Sacrifices, and many other things, which in their ſence would have been a Profanation of the Sabbath, yet being Labour appointed by the LORD, and about his then inſtituted Worſhip, the Prieſts in doing of it were blameleſs, <hi>v</hi> 5. And Chriſt farther tells them, that if they had known what that meaneth, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice, Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6, they would not have condemned the Guiltleſs. And when in the Caſe of the man with a withered Hand, they asked Chriſt, Whether it were <hi>lawful to heal on the Sabbath day, Mat.</hi> 12. 10, and <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 1, 2, 5, Chriſt anſwers, <hi>What man having a Sheep fallen into a pit on the ſabbath day, will not lay hold of it, and lift it out? Ver.</hi> 11. This they themſelves would do, and they alſo knew, that the Life or Good of a Man was to be preferred before the Life or Good of a Beaſt; and ſo Chriſt appeals to them, as condemning themſelves in a Caſe which they allowed, that it was <hi>lawful to do well on the ſabbath day, v.</hi> 12, and cures the withered Hand, <hi>v.</hi> 14. ſee alſo his curing and defending the Cure of the Woman, who had an Infirmity eighteen years, on the Sabbath, <hi>Luke</hi> 13, 10, to 17, where all his Adverſaries were aſhamed of their falſe Gloſſes upon the Law of the Sabbath, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>We have alſo Chriſt curing (and defending that Cure) of the man who had a Dropſy, by the caſe of an Aſs or Ox fallen into a Pit on the Sabbath day, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 1, 2, 5, and of a man who had an Infirmity thirty eight years, on the Sabbath, <hi>John</hi> 5. 5, to 9, and <hi>v.</hi> 16, at which the <hi>Jews</hi> took exception, <hi>v.</hi> 10, where the cured man carried his Bed on the Sabbath day, <hi>v.</hi> 9. See alſo <hi>John</hi> 7. 22, 23, where Chriſt defends his curing on the Sabbath; and <hi>John</hi> 9. 14, 16, Chriſt curing the Blind man.</p>
            <p>By which frequent Counſels and Examples Chriſt did prove and demonſtrate, that the Law for obſerving the Sabbath did no way prohibit doing good on the Sabbath day, when Neceſſity or Mercy to Man or Beaſt did require it; as thoſe who need may read in all the four Evangeliſts at large. And thus Chriſt, as Lord of the Sabbath, who gave it, and who perfectly underſtood the ſcope and meaning of his own Law, gives a clear and ſound Interpretation and Expoſition of that Law.</p>
            <p>But, as to changing the Sabbath day, there is not the leaſt tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in thoſe cited places, or any where elſe, that I can yet find in the Scripture: So that ſuppoſing the Scriptures are able to make
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48100:36"/> the Man of God perfect, and to <hi>make</hi> one <hi>wiſe unto Salvation, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 17. (which is true paſt doubt) I think they are ſufficient to reſolve this Doubt, Which is that Sabbath day the Lord would have us to keep holy. And upon the whole matter I take it to be evident, that by the Teſtimony of Chriſt, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4, and in the Moral Law, and by like expreſs Teſtimony of the Prophets of old, and of <hi>Matthew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> (three of the Evangeliſts) the Lord's day mentioned by <hi>John</hi> (the fourth Evangeliſt) is the Seventh-day Sabbath, and that only is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48100:39"/>
            <p>But if the time of Flight there mentioned, referred to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any Deſolations then, and ſtill yet to come, then this Scripture in <hi>Matthew</hi> is the ſtronger for the Seventh-day Sabbath, though I think it fully ſtrong enough, by referring to Thirty eight years after Chriſt's Death; although divers Expreſſions in thoſe Chapters of <hi>Matthew</hi> 24, and <hi>Mark</hi> 13, (in my weak Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) may and do referr to ſome other great Periods of Time, and, I think, moſt certainly to Chriſt's ſecond Coming, <hi>Mat. 24. 29, 30, Mark</hi> 13. 26, (which anſwers the Queſtion of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 2, 3.) and, it may be, to ſome other times of great Trials, which would come upon the Churches, whereof one may not be far off (but of that I have no certainty.) All which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of longer Times will carry the Obſervation of the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath till the Times there mentioned come, which are not yet come. But however that be, I think it is agreed, that Propheſied Flight was partly fulfilled upon the <hi>Romans</hi> beſieging and taking <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> about Thirty eight years after the Death of Chriſt; and ſo the Sabbath by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20, was not to be abrogated by his Death or Reſurrection, nor Thirty eight years after; which, I think, is as much as to ſay, Not at all, as long as the World ſhould laſt: And whenever the Deſolation Chriſt propheſied in that Chapter ſhould come, he directs his Diſciples, <hi>v.</hi> 3, to <hi>pray</hi> their <hi>Flight might not be in Winter,</hi> (the ſeaſon of Cold or Wet would greaten the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs) <hi>nor on the Sabbath day,</hi> which they were commanded to reſt upon, and to keep holy, for ſuch a Tribulation would be heightned, if it fell upon a day whereon they uſed, and ought (without ſome real cogent neceſſity) to compoſe themſelves to an Holy Reſt. And for (eminently) gracious perſons, as the Apoſtles were, and all Believers in their meaſure are, by any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance (though lawful) to be diverted from any Ordinance of Chriſt, where they may ſedately enjoy Communion with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that for a whole day together, is a matter to be deprecated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And that the Sabbath in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20, was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Seventh-day Sabbath, I have the Opinion (I think) of all that write upon it, that it was the Seventh-day Sabbath they were to <hi>pray</hi> that their Flight might not be upon.</p>
            <p>And I cannot now imagine, that <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> before mentioned, went about to abrogate what Chriſt had ſo confirmed. And upon the whole,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48100:39"/> I do think this one place of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 20, compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 18, (which referrs to the like Caſes with <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove the Seventh-day Sabbath is not altered, but ought to be ſtill obſerved.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe who think a weekly Seventh-day of Reſt was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in <hi>Paradice,</hi> and who acknowledge it to be ordained from the foundation of the World, before the entrance of Sin, and ſo belonged to all Mankind, and that a Seventh-day weekly was directly commanded in the Decalogue, wherein<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Sabbath.</note> the Law of our Creation was revived, and ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all Ceremonial Ordinances; and ſo having no Concern in thoſe fore-cited Paſſages in <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> (which with much more cannot be fairly denied) we ſhall eaſily agree with them, provided they will withal admit (which, we think, upon what has been ſaid, cannot be denied) that the weekly day firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2, was not only <hi>a Seventh day,</hi> but was <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day,</hi> and no other day of the week; and that the Fourth Command doth appoint the ſame ſucceſſive Seventh day, which was firſt commanded, which was alſo obſerved, as before.</p>
            <p>And we now find much of this Controverſie to be reduced by many (except one, who ſtill mainly builds upon Traditions) to this; Whether <hi>The ſeventh</hi> or <hi>A ſeventh day</hi> be required in the Fourth Command; which, to the Impartial, will reduce the Queſtion into a narrow compaſs; for, no man can deny <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth</hi> to be <hi>A ſeventh, (i. e.</hi> the Seventh-day Sabbath to be a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of the week) and yet that admitted, would almoſt end this part of the Controverſie. And the Fourth Command ſpeaks not of <hi>A ſeventh,</hi> which is one of the ſeven, but <hi>The</hi> or <hi>That ſeventh day</hi> which Chriſt reſted upon after the Creation.</p>
            <p>And thoſe above mentioned finding the great miſchief of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Breach upon the Ten Commands, which are ſo often aſſerted throughout the Old and New Teſtament, they now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this; that theſe words [<hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy</hi>] is the ſum and ſubſtance of that whole Command; and they reduce that to [<hi>Remember</hi> a <hi>Sabbath day, to keep it holy;</hi>] and then knock off <hi>The ſeventh day,</hi> as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> leave out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command againſt worſhipping of Images; whereas the words uſed in the Fourth Command are ſuch as ſhould ſtay all Conſtructions which would change the Seventh day, and are ſuch as do not leave the leaſt Pretence or Colour for ſuch a Change.</p>

            <p>The words are, <hi>Exod. 20. 10, The ſeventh day (is) the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;</hi> the leaving out the Verb (<hi>is</hi>) in the Hebrew (I conceive) imports, (as is common in that Tongue) that it was, is, and will or ſhall be the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>And thoſe who would tranſlate it (<hi>A ſeventh</hi>) as they therein depart from our Engliſh Tranſlation, which herein rightly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it (<hi>The ſeventh</hi>) ſo, I think, they manifeſtly depart from the Hebrew Text.</p>

To ſtop up all ſuch Gapps, which one would think largely provided for by the former words of the Command, and to leave it beyond all Doubt and fair Diſpute, with ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Law of God to be a Rule to walk by, (who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are ſuch as we now reaſon with) the Lord has, I think, made ſure work againſt this Objection, in <hi>v.</hi> 11, where he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly condeſcends to give us a Reaſon why we are to <hi>keep holy the ſeventh day,</hi> becauſe <hi>in ſix days he made</hi> theſe Heavens (which we ſee) and this Earth (which we ſtand and lye upon.)

And it ſeems to me impoſſible for any but God only, who is infinite in Wiſdom, in ſo few words, ſo warily, ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with like exact Wiſdom and Circumſpection, to ſecure any thing by words as this Command (in the body of the Ten Commands); and, the very Seventh day (in the heart of the Fourth Command) is ſecured by Chriſt againſt this new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and Cavil of <hi>A ſeventh,</hi> and not <hi>The</hi> or <hi>That ſeventh:</hi> Such ſurely deal over-ſlightly, and ſomewhat quibble with the word, who take ſuch a liberty to turn (<hi>The</hi>) into (<hi>A</hi>), and ſo to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the commanded day, and to lay it aſide, and then to ſet up another Day of Reſt every week; which (as has been ſaid) we do not find commanded by the Lord; when they certainly know, that the Day obſerved in obedience to the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and Proſelytes, was the Seventh day, and no other, and the Sabbath and Seventh day did both reſult in the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath, and both relate to the firſt Sabbath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2, ordained by Chriſt, which they know was the Seventh day, and no other day of the week: And whoſoever (not over-prejudic'd) does read this Command, I think, will find this ſtrongly there enforced, <hi>viz.</hi> That the weekly day the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor reſted on, is the very day to which this Command referrs, and that all the World, who have and receive the Word, do know, and confeſs, was not the firſt, nor ſixth, but the ſeventh day of the week, and that day only, and no other day; and upon this I do inſiſt.</p>
            <p>And here I commend to the Reader <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10, where the Lord promiſes to put his Laws into the Minds: of his People, and to write them in their Hearts, which is called a <hi>new Covenant, v.</hi> 8, with which we may compare <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, which Law promiſed to be written in our Hearts, I think, is the Moral Law, which Moral Law is the Ten Commands, whereof the Fourth is one: And with how many Diſtinctions muſt the Word, the Promiſes, New Covenant, and Command be mangled, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to ſuch a new ſence of the Firſt day? Which change of the day (well conſidered) may be one cauſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtanding off from Chriſt; <hi>Who will be converted, grafted into Chriſt, and ſaved by him? Rom.</hi> 11. 7,—26.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48100:41"/>
            <p>And, I hear, ſome of late, in defence of the Firſt day, have poſitively affirmed, that the Firſt day of the week is the Seventh day of the week, and ſo the very day which the Letter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand requires; by which Rule that which the Word calls the Seventh day, ſhould then become the Sixth, and the Sixth the Fifth, and ſo all the days in confuſion, and all the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> hitherto in the World out in their reckoning of Seven.</p>
            <p>Whilſt I was conſidering this Queſtion, a learned Manuſcript was ſent me from an unknown Author, who, to maintain the Firſt day of the week to be the Seventh day, by the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſays to this effect; That we ought to invert the Days, (<hi>i. e.</hi> to reckon them backward) and then that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures call the Seventh day is the Firſt, the Sixth the Second, the Fifth the Third, the Fourth the Fourth, the Third the Fifth, the Second the Sixth, and then the Firſt is the Seventh; ſo great contrariety there is, and muſt needs be, in defending a Paradox.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. and Anſ.</hi> Some farther object, That the Sabbath was a Type, and withal acknowledge it a Type of that Reſt which is above with Chriſt, in the upper World; which we ſhall eaſily admit, provided ſuch will admit alſo (what we think cannot be denied to Types) that the Sabbath, which is the Type, continue till Heaven the Antitype do come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. and Anſ.</hi> Thoſe who build the whole of this Change upon the Authority of the Church, and not upon the Word, (which Word is againſt them) who are very eminent, may take this ſhort Anſwer: That if the Church have Power to change one of the Commands, the Conſequence is plain, why may not the Church change more? If any one of them be left to the Diſcretion of the Church, certainly all are expoſed (as was ſaid before.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. and Anſ.</hi> Some Objectors there are, who miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding certain general Expreſſions in <hi>Paul</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Epiſtles, about the Law, miſapply them againſt the Ten Commands, and ſo lay aſide all the Moral Law; which general Expreſſions are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant of the Ceremonial Laws, and may ſometimes be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt ſome then erroneous Conceits of Juſtification, by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48100:41"/> to the Moral Law. And others taking advantage of ſome incautelous Writings, about the Privileges purchaſed by Chriſt, have that way attempted to throw down the Ten Commands, (a Doctrine which would ſurely pleaſe many in this debauched, licentious, and erroneous Age, if it would hold) and ſome of theſe (with the Law) take away the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. and Anſ.</hi> One thinks the Decalogue is not at all in force to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and thinks the Preface to it, <hi>Exod. 20. 2, (I the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>out of the Houſe of Bondage</hi>) was to ſhew, that it (only) concerned the <hi>Jews.</hi> Whereas if we conſider, that the Church then in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was the Church of Chriſt, and that Deliverance was of the whole then viſible Church of Chriſt in the World, amongſt whom there were alſo many <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> I think it may be allow'd, that the Preface concerns all Chriſtians; and that Deliverance (expreſſed in the Preface (as before) ought to be celebrated in all After-ages, by all Chriſtians in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is often mention in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and other Scriptures, and ſo that Conſideration from the Preface does not leſſen the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Decalogue upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but ſtrengthen it.</p>
            <p>And for the Obligation of the Decalogue, when I find Chriſt ſo directly confirming the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18, and <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 17, (by which Law is underſtood the Decalogue) I think I ought not to be over-ruled by any man's contrary Opinion, whatever eſteem I have of thoſe who thus write, and of many uſeful things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 19, and <hi>John 14. 15, If ye love me, keep my Commands:</hi> By which Commands the Decalogue is generally underſtood.</p>
            <p>I do believe that Text, <hi>Bleſſed are they who do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rev.</hi> 22. 14, relates to the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>And thoſe general Expreſſions about the Law, in the <hi>Acts</hi> and Epiſtles, will be better underſtood if we reflect upon the occaſion of them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1, certain men taught the Brethren, <hi>Except ye be circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye cannot be ſaved:</hi> Where it was Circumciſion and the Ceremonial Law that was in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, not the Moral Law; the Ceremonial Laws were as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then lain aſide by the Death of Chriſt, and by the Holy Spirit; as is plain in that Chapter. And when <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 21. 17, 18, 21,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48100:42"/> came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſome told him, that many Thouſands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who believed, were zealous of the Law, (<hi>i. e.</hi> of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law) and were informed of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he taught the <hi>Jews</hi> which were among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to forſake <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Laws given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, They <hi>ought not to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their Children, neither to walk after the Cuſtoms;</hi> and then they adviſe <hi>Paul</hi> to purifie himſelf, to remove that Objection; to whoſe Advice <hi>Paul</hi> yields, <hi>v.</hi> 24, 25, 26, which occaſion'd the Commotion, <hi>v. 27, 28, Crying, Men of</hi> Iſrael <hi>help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where againſt the Law (i. e.</hi> the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law) <hi>of Purifications and Offerings, v.</hi> 26. And yet theſe Texts ſpeak of the Law in general, but cannot be underſtood as meant of the Ten Commands, becauſe the Ten Commands were not in diſpute.</p>
            <p>The Law which concerned Circumciſion and Purifications, with their Offerings, (which were all ceremonial) was that only then in queſtion, and ſo becomes applicable to that Law in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and not at all to the Ten Commands, or any jot or tittle of them, which were not in queſtion, which (as before) ſtand fully eſtabliſhed. And this Difference the Occaſion and Context do beſt explain; and this in <hi>Acts</hi> 21, is an Inſtance may open divers Expreſſions about the Law in ſome of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; for <hi>Paul,</hi> in thoſe Primitive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Times, when the Ceremonial Law was freſh in memory, and the Goſpel newly preached, had much ado to remove the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> converted <hi>Jews</hi> from Circumciſion and other Ceremonials; as we find in his Epiſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19, 20, where in the 20th Verſe, <hi>Law,</hi> as I think, referrs to the Ceremonial Law, where to the <hi>Jews</hi> he became as a <hi>Jew;</hi> and in the 21ſt Verſe, <hi>Law</hi> referrs to the Moral Law, which, unto Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> was under: And in other Caſes <hi>Paul,</hi> to preſerve the Liberty he had in Chriſt Jeſus, ſays, <hi>Titus was not compelled to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, Gal. 2. 3, 4, Acts</hi> 16. 3. a Liberty which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for his People, to be no longer in Bondage to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Laws: And upon this Difference we find <hi>Paul</hi> withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Peter</hi> to the face, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11, 12, (which in a good caſe may ſtill be done to others, though otherwiſe—never ſo eminent.) And as to this Caſe of Circumciſion, <hi>Paul</hi> effectually lays that aſide, by ſaying, that <hi>if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing, Gal.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, for, thoſe who were for Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion were Debtors to the whole Law (<hi>i. e.</hi> to all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48100:42"/> Law) and therefore he there adviſes them to <hi>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free,</hi> and not to be entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled again with that Yoke of Bondage.</p>
            <p>It may be alſo ſome amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits<note place="margin">Juſtified not by the Law.</note> of being juſtified by the Law, of ſuch <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>they</hi> were <hi>fallen from Grace,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt was become of none effect to them, Gal.</hi> 5. 4, which Saying of <hi>Paul</hi> is true, <hi>Let their conceit referr to what Law it would, for if Righteouſneſs be by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain, Gal.</hi> 2. 21. It ſeems, ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> thought, if they were circumciſed, and obſerved the external and ceremonial part of the Law, they ſhould be ſure to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and if they were that which we call Morally Righteous, and as concerning the Law (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf) blameleſs, they thought then, as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do now, that their Works would ſave them. And the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> think alſo they may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererrogate, whence ariſes the Doctrine of Merits of the Saints, and Indulgences, whereas true Juſtification is, and ever was, only by Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> by Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, by Faith in whom <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified, <hi>Rom. 4. 3, 9, Gal. 3. 6, Jam.</hi> 2. 23, to whom the Goſpel was before preached by that word, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be juſtified, Gal.</hi> 3. 8. And yet all this Doctrine about Juſtification by Faith doth no way hurt or touch the Doctrin of Obedience to Chriſt's Ten Commands, nor ſet any man at liberty to ſin in any thing, as ſome weakly, and others maliciouſly would inferr, for of that true Faith, univerſal and ſincere conformity to the Laws of Chriſt, (<hi>i. e.</hi> to the Ten Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And, <hi>'tis by Faith a Believer goes when God commands him, Heb.</hi> 11. 8, (and this I write alſo to avoid Slanders.) And on this Subject the generality of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Miniſters have written very well; and if any dream that <hi>Paul</hi> made void the Moral Law by preaching up <hi>Faith,</hi> God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, (or be it nor) as the Greek imports: <hi>Yea, he eſtabliſhed the Law, Rom.</hi> 3. 31. And 'tis, as I have thought, obſervable in the 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 15, 16, 17, Peter</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Paul</hi> and his Epiſtles, ſays, <hi>in which are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Which Commands ſome laying aſide, hold the Tradition of Men, and the Commandments of Men, and ſo <hi>lay aſide the Commandments of God, Mark</hi> 7. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>The Law our Lord has given us in the Ten Commands is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, which abſolutely requires in All all manner of true Love to GOD and Man, <hi>on which Two Commands</hi> (which include the Commands of both Tables, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the Ten Commands) <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets, Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38, 39, 40.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> As for ſuch as think that the Bleſſing and Sanctification in the Fourth Command are not appropriated to the Seventh day, but to the Sabbath day, becauſe of the words there, <hi>Wherefore the Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it,</hi> and ſo think the change of the Seventh day to be thereby inſinuated:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The expreſs words of the Command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10, are, <hi>The ſeventh day (is) the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;</hi> and ſo the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day was that day, and that Sabbath day which he bleſſed and ſanctified: Read the Command, and Judge, and the Seventh day is there twice named.</p>
            <p>Theſe I take to be the great Objections, and were it not that the Firſt day hath got poſſeſſion of the Names which belong not to it, and had we not been generally educated in this Miſtake, wherein alſo ſome of us have lived long, and ſo are rivetted, and this defended by Writers of Renown in the World, I ſee little
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48100:43"/> difficulty in this Queſtion, if the Scriptures (as they ought) be the Rule to judge it by.</p>
            <p>As to the time when the Sabbath doth begin,<note place="margin">Sabbath when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</note> I conceive it not to be at Midnight, nor to end at Midnight after, (when we generally ſleep) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reckoning of this Kingdom; nor at Noon, as ſome other Countries reckon; nor in the Morning, when we uſually riſe, as upon other days, and ſo to end at Night, when we uſually go to Bed, as upon other days, as others reckon; but upon the Evening before, and ſo to the Evening after, as the Lord reckons the Days to begin and end, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, and I do no where find that firſt Diſtribution of Days altered or diſtributed by Him; wherein Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> (in the latter end of his learned Book for the Firſt day) having done very well, I referr the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (who makes any doubt thereof) to him, for farther ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that, if need be.</p>
            <p>As for the manner of keeping <hi>holy the Sabbath day,</hi> there is in Principle no great variety of Opinion or Practice amongſt the Proteſtants, but what an ordinary Underſtanding, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live by Rule, may with a little help reſolve; although I have known ſome over-ſtrict, and many overlooſe therein: And it ſeems, in ſhort, to lye in a lively ſpiritual Converſe with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, in private Duties and publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, (where they may be had) and in a Holy Reſt all that day, ſaving only nightly and dayly emergent Caſes of Neceſſity and Mercy, for Men and Beaſts, Sick and Well, which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are well ſtated by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>For, that which I enquire is, Whether the Law of the Fourth Command, as to the Seventh-day Sabbath, be repealed or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any Word of God: Which Enquiry may be allowed to one that is no Miniſter, and indeed to every Chriſtian whoin in Practice it equally concerns with me.</p>
            <p>As to the publick Worſhip of that day, I think it<note place="margin">Eabbath Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> 
               <hi>worthy</hi> ſome farther Enquiry, Whether that Worſhip ſhould not be twice as much as the Evening or the Morning Worſhip ordinarily is; and, Whether all that Publick Worſhip of the Sabbath ſhould not be performed at one Publick Meeting: Which Evening and Morning-Worſhip in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Seaſons is not to be intermitted upon the Sabbath day; and for this ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 28. 3, 4, 8, 9. And I cannot, upon the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48100:44"/> ſudden recollect, from the Old or New Teſtament, any light of two diſtinct publick meetings of the Churches, one before Noon, and the other in the Afternoon, as Standing-Duties of the Sabbath day, and as diſtinct from the Evening and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Worſhip; but this I ſubmit to farther Enquiry. We have one Pſalm for the Sabbath day, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 92) and but one expreſly appointed for that day, (that I find) although the reſt of the Pſalms may be uſed on that day, as the reſt of the Scriptures. And as to the time of that one Publick Meeting and Worſhip of the Churches, upon the Sabbath, I think it would be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether the Direction we have about it be not towards Noon; which ſeems to be the time of feeding and reſting ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Flocks, <hi>Solomon's Song, ch. 1. v. 7. Evening and Morning, and at Noon, will I pray and cry aloud, Pſal.</hi> 55. 17. And <hi>Daniel</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon his Knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave Thanks before his God, as he did afore-time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10, 13. which (as I take it) were the three ſtated times of Worſhip among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but what certain Rule the <hi>Jews</hi> had from God, as to their daily preciſe times of Evening and Morning. Worſhip, I know not, but only <hi>Evening and Morning, Exod. 29. 39, 41, 42, 43, 45. Num.</hi> 28. 4, 8. When the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> was given to the Diſciples, it was the third hour of the day, (which was our Nine of the Clock) <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 3, 4, 15. And <hi>Peter</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was about the ſixth hour, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 9, (which was about our Noon.) <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>went into the Temple at the ninth hour, the hour of Prayer, Acts</hi> 3. 1, for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> accounted the twelve hours of the day thus; our ſix of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was their firſt, our ninth their third hour of the day, our twelve of the Clock at Noon their ſixth hour, our three of the Clock in the Afternoon their ninth hour, our ſix of the Clock at Evening their twelfth hour (as Scholars know); ſo that their ſixth hour was Noon, and <hi>Peter</hi>'s Viſion was about Noon. And <hi>Cornelius was praying about the ninth hour, Acts</hi> 10. 30. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> or <hi>Cornelius,</hi> or this of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were upon the Sabbath, (being not directly written that I know) I cannot tell: And although we have ſo much of our LORD's conſtant keeping of the Sabbath, (as his manner was) and of <hi>Paul</hi>'s keeping the Sabbath (as his manner was) yet I do not remember any Inſtance of their publick congregating or preaching above once upon that day.

            <p>But if that be the Mind of Chriſt which he has directed in his Word, I think there is much to be ſaid for it, as accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ordinary Caſes of Mankind, both ſpiritual and worldly; and I am credibly informed, that in ſome parts of <hi>England</hi> Chriſtians do meet but once upon the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>As for Tradition, I mean, ſo far as I can weakly<note place="margin">Tradition.</note> gather from my ſmall Stock of Books, about the Seventh-day Sabbath, when the obſervation thereof ended, and about the Firſt day, when the obſervation thereof began amongſt any Chriſtians, (hoping the World may hereafter have a more exact account thereof (if need be) from ſome one or other, who has better Abilities, a better Library, and more Youth, Strength, and Leiſure, whom the Lord may raiſe up) I ſhall offer ſuch broken imperfect Collections as I can, after ſo many Removes of my little Study (by the Diſtreſſes of this Age.) But this I premiſe, that my own cleareſt ſatisfaction, that the Seventh-day Sabbath is not altered, came by the means of the Scriptures, and the Writings of the moſt Conſciencious and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Firſt day; and after all, I am of this opinion, That the Sabbath cannot be repealed or altered, but by the ſame Power and Authority which firſt commanded it, which was our LORD himſelf. As for me, it was (as I remember) ſome years after I was convinced of the Seventh day Sabbath, before I had ſeen any Book that was written for it, or before I had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with any perſon that was for the obſervation thereof; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>An Anſwer to that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10, I think, you have before, and that the Lord's day there mentioned is not the Firſt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Seventh day of the week, the true Lord's day.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And for further anſwer to the reſt of that poſitive Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I ſhall ſhew, that there have been many Chriſtian Churches, who have for ſome Hundreds of years after Chriſt aſſembled for Publick Worſhip on the Seventh day Sabbath; which will prove, there have been ſome Diſſenters from his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in former times. And to the reſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt,</hi> I anſwer firſt, That the Seventh-day Sabbath was obſerved for Publick Worſhip, during the Apoſtles time, (I think) is plain in the Scriptures, and ſo prov'd before in the Anſwers to the Ninth and Tenth Queſtions. And, who could change it after that, <hi>Non Conſtat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> And if it were true, that the Churches ever ſince the Apoſtles days, One thouſand Six hundred years together, had walked contrary to the Commands of God, yet the Commands are the ſame, and oblige us now, juſt as they did the Apoſtles, and others, in Chriſt's time, and after his Death; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Practiſe of all the World (if it were ſo) will not impeach any one of Chriſt's Commands, nor make thoſe Hereticks that obſerve them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> For the clearing up of this Matter of Fact, I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome broken Collections which I have made out of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, for the obſervation of the Seventh-day Sabbath, and againſt it for the Firſt day; which I think will anſwer theſe two laſt Objections.</p>

               <hi>Cent. 5. fol.</hi> 647, Thoſe who lived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had various times of aſſembling, and, without doubt, in other Neighbour-Churches; yet it is certain, there was one day of the whole week conſtituted, in which the promiſcuous Multitude once aſſembled to hear Sermons: For ſo ſays <hi>Chryſoſtom, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſychius,</hi> Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the ſecond Book of Commentaries on the Ninth Chapter of <hi>Leviticus, In ſome places of</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi> Egypt <hi>Men aſſembled in the Church upon the Sabbath day, fol.</hi> 648. This was in the Fifth Century.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cent. 5, fol.</hi> 685, 'tis ſaid, Thoſe who faſted, and thoſe who dined upon the Sabbath lived in Concord; and, that it was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the ſame Church to have ſome dining and ſome faſting upon the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>In the Eaſtern Churches they never faſt upon the Sabbath, one (Sabbath) of the whole year excepted, which is before the Paſſover; the Weſtern Churches (by which I think they mean <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereabout) obſerved the contrary. And they quote <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as ſpeaking of this Diverſity, how they faſted at <hi>Rome</hi> on the Sabbath, which if they ſhould ſay were ſinful, then they ſhould condemn the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and many places near to it, and farther from it: And if they ſhould think it ſinful not to faſt upon the Sabbath, then they ſhould blame <hi>many Eaſtern Churches,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48100:49"/> and the far greater part of the Chriſtian World:</hi> This (as I take it) is in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Jerome,</hi> and in another Letter to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulanus,</hi> where he profeſſedly writes of the Faſt upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and plainly ſhews, <hi>that faſting upon the Sabbath day was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to</hi> Rome, <hi>and a few Weſtern Churches.</hi> And if any ask why I tranſcribe Authorities to prove, that for ſo many hundred years after Chriſt, ſome Dined and ſome Faſted upon the Sabbath day,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, to ſhew that all the Chriſtians in the World did agree which was the Sabbath day, and which the Firſt day of the week, and that they all agreed to call the Seventh day of the week the Sabbath day; which ſome few now pretend to doubt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew whence the Alteration was from keeping the Sabbath day as a Feſtival, and turning it into a Faſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew, that this Practice, by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, was not followed by the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor by the far greater part of the Chriſtian World for Five hundred years after Chriſt; nor is it (as I think) by ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches to this day, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now, that publick Faſting-days (as this was) were kept holy to God, as well as Feſtivals, is known to all Chriſtians, who upon publick Faſting days (where they have liberty) do aſſemble for the Worſhip of God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtians do agree upon a day to aſſemble, for the Publick Worſhip of God in Chriſt, there does appear no great difference, whether they Feaſt or Faſt upon that day, only here ſeems to be the art of it: The Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were about to change the Sabbath, and, it ſeems, devis'd (amongſt others) this <hi>medium</hi> for one, To turn the Sabbath into a Faſt before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and this was under a ſpecious pretence, as, for the Honour of Chriſt, and in memory of his Paſſion, as the Firſt day was in memory of his Reſurrection; and therefore they firſt contended much about obſerving <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the Firſt day of the week, which was to be a yearly Feſtival, (whereof more hereafter) and the Sabbath before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> (becauſe of our Lord's Body lying in the Grave) to be kept as a yearly Faſt, and ſo, by degrees, every <hi>Sunday</hi> to be a Feſtival, and kept as a weekly Sabbath, and every Sabbath to be turn'd into a weekly Faſt, and by degrees, to be totally laid aſide, and no more obſerv'd as the inſtituted Sabbath, but for ever after to be kept only as a weekly Faſt, as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48100:50"/> it is amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and ſome others, to this day. This <hi>Legerdemain</hi> ſeems plain to ſuch as are unbiaſs'd, and have look'd a little into Church-Hiſtory (whereof more hereafter.)</p>

               <p>But he ſays, This ſeems to be inconvenient, that the Precept for obſerving the Sabbath ſhould be put amongſt the Precepts of the Decalogue, if it do not at all belong to the Decalogue.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, the Firſt day of the week, in ſome few places, where Popery much prevailed, at that time might be obſerved under the name of the Dominical day as a Feſtival, and from the Contention which had been, and then was, between the <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, about obſerving the Paſſover year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the weekly Feſtival upon the Dominical day, it came to paſs (as I think) that ſo many Popes, Abbots, Biſhops, Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aſſumed the name of <hi>Dominicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As before, (whilſt the Diſputes between the Popes and the ancient Churches laſted) about what day to keep the Paſſover upon, divers of the Popes and Antipopes aſſumed the name of <hi>Paſchalis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when this Controverſie about the Sabbath was by the Popes ſomewhat quieted in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts, which was about the Thirteenth Century, (whereof more afterward) then ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Dominicus</hi> the Hermit, and then St. <hi>Dominic</hi> about 1243, (<hi>i. e.</hi> about 447 years ſince) and erects the Order of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> which is continued amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to this day.</p>

               </p>
               <p>By which it is evident, that ſome then held themſelves and others obliged to keep holy the Sabbath, and preached it up, (and probably in <hi>Rome</hi>) though the Pope calls it an Error. This was in the ſeventh Century.</p>
               <p>So as notwithſtanding all the great contrary Affirmations and Boaſtings, there are in the ancient Hiſtories many Evidences of Tradition for the Seventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               <p>Then the Enemy of Mankind envying theſe and other Admonitions of this Holy Man, put into the Heart of the King and Princes of Darkneſs, (ſo, it ſeems, the King and Nobility of <hi>England</hi> did not keep <hi>Sunday</hi> at that time) that they commanded, That all who ſhould keep (or obſerve) the aforeſaid Traditions, and chiefly, all who had caſt down the Market for things vendible upon the Dominical days, ſhould be brought to the King's Court, (or to the King's Examination) to make ſatisfaction (or purge themſelves) about obſerving the the Dominical day.</p>
               <p>But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we ought to obey rather than men, who illuſtrated, (or made famous) and as exceedingly renowned, dedicated unto himſelf this day (which we call Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minical, or Lord's day) by his Birth, and by his Reſurrection, by his Coming, and by the ſending the Holy Spirit upon his Diſciples, he raiſed up Miracles of his Virtue, and thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it upon ſome Tranſgreſſors of the Dominical day.</p>
               <p>Upon a certain Sabbath, <hi>after the ninth [hour</hi>] a certain Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter in <hi>Beverlac,</hi> making a Wooden Pin againſt the wholſome Admonitions of his Wife, being ſtruck with a <hi>Palſie,</hi> fell to the Ground.

And I think it may be true alſo, that ſome Judgments have been executed upon Violaters of the Sabbath, whereof the Stick gatherer of old is one famous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and whereof I could aſſign ſome very Signal, within theſe few years paſt, if that were a good way of reaſoning: And what more there may yet be I know not, Chriſt can vindicate his Commands, and recover his own, when, and by what methods ſhall pleaſe him, and to him I wholly leave it: But, this I am fully ſatisfied in, that he that walks according to his Commands has no manner of cauſe to fear his Diſpleaſure for obedience to his Will.</p>
               <p>And this I aſſign as Anſwer to the many Reflections about Judgments ſuppoſed to be inflicted in this Caſe, which Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God I acknowledge to be a great Deep, and hard to be fathom'd by the Wiſeſt, and are ſometimes eaſie to be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both ways by willing Minds, but are then beſt underſtood, when conſidered as directly puniſhing Sins againſt the plain Commands and Word of God.</p>
               <p>Now, although this Precedent of <hi>Euſtachius</hi> be ſomewhat long, yet being Seconded by a Council, and that tranſmitted, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to all the World, in one of the Volumes of the General and Provincial Councils, (out of which I have tranſlated it) and this paſſing at the initiating or firſt bringing in of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Firſt day of the week, or <hi>Sunday,</hi> into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is famous for having the Goſpel early preached there, (and in this as famous, <hi>viz.</hi> for not receiving this Innovation ſo ſoon as ſome other parts of the World); and <hi>England</hi> being then much of the ſame mind, (as before has been ſaid) and this being one Precedent, which may ſerve to abate what is printed about the Firſt day, as if all the World, ſince Chriſt and the Apoſtles time, had obſerved it, and as if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48100:60"/> the Sabbath ever ſince had been univerſally laid aſide; I have therefore inſerted it, and from hence at preſent ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
               <p>That the Firſt day (which ſome call the Dominical or Lord's day) was not obſerved by the Chriſtian Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (nor, I think, by <hi>England</hi>) Twelve hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Of the Dominical day the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> ſay, It was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Council in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the obſervation of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minical day, newly and lately brought into that Kingdom, (as is before noted out of <hi>Binius</hi>) That it ſhould be holy from the Twelfth hour of <hi>Saturday</hi> Even, till <hi>Monday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, <hi>fol.</hi> 788, a Synod in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1203, for inaugurating the King, and the Feaſt of the Sabbath, which, I think, might be about a year or two after the Abbot of <hi>Flay</hi>'s being there, <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> called a Council of the Chief of his Kingdom, and commanded them to do Homage to his Son <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There came alſo a Legate from the Pope with a Sword and a purple Hat, Indulgences and Priviledges to the young King; alſo there it is decreed, That <hi>Saturday,</hi> from the Twelfth hour at Noon, ſhould be holy; That the People ſhould do nothing prophane, but apply themſelves to things ſacred, and this they ſhould do even until <hi>Monday. Boetius, lib. 13, de Scotis, fol.</hi> 788, which place in an haſty ſeeking I could not find.</p>
               <p>By inaugurating the Sabbath was the more ſolemn ſettling of that matter, which was, as I gueſs, about a year or two before firſt initiated, or brought in, by the Abbot of <hi>Flay.</hi> As <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, whether this inaugurating were not by the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid to be by the King and the Council, of the Chief of his Kingdom, I cannot ſay, but this laſt ſeems to me moſt probable.</p>
               <p>But that makes no difference in the caſe there, and this well agrees with that of the Abbot of <hi>Flay,</hi> as I think about a year or two before. And how far this Precedent, after the fine Device of the Epiſtle from Heaven, and after this Abbot of <hi>Flay</hi>'s co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>York,</hi> may reach to this Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> you may ſee there.</p>

               <p>I ſhall quote <hi>Binius</hi> once more, the ſame Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 1445, where he ſays, <q>At a Council at <hi>London,</hi> celebrated by <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III, <hi>Ann. Chriſti</hi> 1200, they decree, That every Dominical day the <hi>Hoſtia</hi> ſhould he renewed.</q> (The <hi>Hoſtia</hi> is the Hoſt in the Popiſh Maſs (<hi>i. e.</hi> a round Wafer Cake) which after the Prieſt's Conſecration, they ſuppoſe to be the Body of Chriſt.)</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> then, and ſome time before, and long after, till <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time, were devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> howſoever the Kings and Civil Government were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, whereof we find a little in the Preſident before cited of <hi>Euſtachius;</hi> and we have no Statute made for <hi>Sunday</hi> till that in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, which was but about 150 years ſince, (whereof more hereafter.)</p>
               <p>And <hi>Binius, fol.</hi> 877, 878, In the time of Pope <hi>Marcellus</hi> II, there were ſome who kept the Sabbath day, <hi>Sabbatarii,</hi> (which, I think, was in <hi>Rome</hi>) who it ſeems held, that the Dominical day was not to be obſerved (<hi>Dominicam diem non colendam</hi>) and this was <hi>An.</hi> 1555, in the ſixteenth Century; but they (if it be true what is written of them) by Popiſh Writers, were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Heretical, as in their ſence all Diſſenters from them are.</p>
               <p>And if they were Hereticks, yet this will diſprove part of the Aſſertion before mentioned, but frequently the moſt Orthodox were by them called Hereticks, as they are by them and others to this day.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Thirteenth Century, <hi>f.</hi> 264, B, and <hi>fol.</hi> 357, C, D, of introducing the Dominical day into <hi>Scotland,</hi> we have before in the Story of the Abbot of <hi>Flay,</hi> and the King's Council of <hi>Scotland, An. Dom.</hi> 1203.</p>

                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 385, a Synod was held at <hi>Oxford, An.</hi> 1223, by <hi>Stephen</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where they determine, That all Dominical days be kept with all veneration, and a Faſt upon the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that how far ſome part of <hi>England</hi> then followed the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is worth further enquiry, which is about Twenty one years after that of the Abbot of <hi>Flay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the ſum of what I have collected out of thoſe Books: As for the Books quoted (by <hi>Binius,</hi> by the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> and by <hi>Lucius</hi>) I had very few of them, where thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages probably would be found more at large, which ſuch as are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48100:61"/> furniſhed with, or have the uſe of a better Study, may collect if they pleaſe, and give a more exact account thereof. But theſe Writers, as to Matters of Fact written by them, I take to be of Credit, although one of them, <hi>viz. Binius,</hi> were a profeſt <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> and Canon of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Collen,</hi> and writ <hi>permiſſu ſuperiorunt:</hi> But the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> were Proteſtants, and are generally allowed, for ought I know, as perſons of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their Collections. So that as to the Matters of Fact which I have brokenly gathered from them, ſome for, and ſome againſt my Opinion, I think there remains little doubt; Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from what I have collected I leave to the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <hi>Binius</hi>'s 13th Century. King <hi>John,</hi> about <hi>Ann.

After he was humbled by that Excommunication and Interdiction, this King, <hi>An.</hi> 15. of his Reign, by Writ removes the Market of the City of <hi>Exon,</hi> from the Dominical or firſt day of the week, on which it was formerly held, to <hi>Monday. Prinn</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Pope's Uſurpations, <hi>part 3, fol.</hi> 17. So that <hi>Exon</hi> kept Markets on <hi>Sunday</hi> above 1200 years after Chriſt. And the Market of <hi>Launceſton</hi> was from the firſt to the fifth day of the week. And in the 2d and 3d of <hi>Henry</hi> III, the next King ſucceeding King <hi>John,</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi> III<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> removes another Market in <hi>Devon,</hi> and Ten more in other Counties, from the Firſt day to other days of the week: Which alteration of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets (which we find before in the Caſe of the Abbot of <hi>Flay</hi>) King <hi>John</hi> would not then admit. And 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> III, <hi>Prinn</hi>'s <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Courts, fol.</hi> 153, there is the King's Writ (<hi>Ballinis de Haſtings</hi>) to anſwer before the Juſtices, for removing Markets from one day to another, without the King's Licence, unleſs it be from the Dominical day: It ſeems ſome then held Markets on that day, but might remove them to another day without the King's Licence.

               <p>In our Records, we find by the Writs to ſummon Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they were of old appointed to meet upon <hi>Sundays.

               <p>
                  <hi>England,</hi> (which one lately, in his Defence of the Firſt day, calls a barbarous and remote Corner of the World) had the Goſpel here preached in the Firſt Century, (as Hiſtorians ſay) and it was afterward generally entertained for ſome hundreds of years, before they received the Change of the Paſſover to the Dominical day, and (by the beſt Collection I can make with my few Books) about 1200 years (or more) before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the obſervation of <hi>Sunday,</hi> and yet had a weekly day of Reſt, which all the Records of old, yet extant, and down along to this day, did then, and do ſtill, call the Sabbath day: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once received the Goſpel, they did not ſo ſoon receive Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in Religion for the worſe, as other places nearer to <hi>Rome;</hi> as appears by the Caſe of the Paſſover, the change of which from the 14th day of the firſt Moon, to the firſt day of the week, was not here admitted (as I take it) till the Sixth or Seventh Century (and then alſo but in part) as appears in the Paſſage of Biſhop <hi>Coleman,</hi> which Alteration <hi>Scotland</hi> then refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And for the Firſt day, it ſeems to be introduced by the Popes and their Agents, by degrees, but not generally to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>England</hi> (nor at all in <hi>Scotland</hi>) till the beginning of the 13th Century, and without any Law (that I can recollect) made by the King and Parliament, till <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48100:62"/> time, 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> VI, <hi>cap.</hi> 3, which Act was made about 150. years ſince, where <hi>Sunday,</hi> and many Holy-days, the Feaſt of <hi>All-ſaints</hi> and of <hi>Holy Innocents,</hi> are eſtabliſhed Feſtivals, and jumbled all together, (it ſeems then eſteemed much alike.) Which Act provides, that it ſhall be lawful for Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men, Labourers, Fiſhermen, and all others, in Harveſt, or any time of the year, when Neceſſity ſhall require, to labour, ride, fiſh, or work any kind of Work at their free will and pleaſure, upon any of the ſaid days. So that the Civil Government of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> did never (that I find) give Countenance to <hi>Sunday</hi> by any Act, till about 150 years ſince, and then allowed a Liberty ſo large, as ſhews what Eſteem they had of that, as well as other Holy days: Tho', I remember, in one of the Engliſh Chronicles, I met with an Act of the Common-Council of <hi>London,</hi> in favour of the Firſt day (as I take it) about their Markets, which was ſome time before this, but when I do not remember.</p>
               <p>That the Seventh day of the week has held the name of the Sabbath from the beginning of the World to this day, I take to be evident; though 'tis alſo true, that ſome late Writers (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Eighty years, or thereabout) have endeavoured to apply the name of the Sabbath to the Firſt day, which (as is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by others) is no where given to it in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The ancient Liturgies do prove this, and the Maſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> book now in uſe ſtill retains the Name of the Sabbath for the Seventh day.</p>
               <p>Our own Records in <hi>England</hi> do alſo prove this; thoſe of the Houſe of Lords, the higheſt Court of <hi>England, Elſing. fol.</hi> 94, 95, and their Journals to this day, whereof I have ſeen many; and every one that will, may ſee, that all things enter'd in the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of that Houſe, as done upon the Seventh day, are enter'd as done <hi>Die Sabbati,</hi> upon the Sabbath day, (<hi>i. e.</hi> upon the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Sabbath.) And the like Orders for the Houſe of Commons are weekly printed (<hi>Sabbati</hi>) for the Seventh day.</p>
               <p>The Rules and Records of the <hi>Kings Bench, Common Pleas,</hi> and the Latin Records in the King's <hi>Court of Exchequer,</hi> and in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> and thoſe alſo in the <hi>Chequer-Chamber,</hi> do call the Seventh day the Sabbath (whereof I have now ſome in my Hand.)</p>
               <p>This all Lawyers and Attorneys know, and all others, (who will ask the Queſtion) may know); and there is no other Latin Word in the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> nor any Latin Proceſs from any of them for the Seventh day, but (<hi>die Sabbati</hi>) the Sabbath
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48100:62"/> day, and (<hi>Sabbati</hi>) upon the Sabbath; but when the Courts began to ſit upon the Sabbath, I do not remember to have found, but gueſs it might be after <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, who died about Three hundred and fourteen years ſince.</p>
               <p>So that this Queſtion is not yet ſo fully ſettled, but that ſome did long obſerve the Seventh day Sabbath, and that day has the name of the Sabbath to this day; and I remember nothing by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> in favour of the Firſt day, till the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, about One hundred and forty years ſince, (whereof before.) All which put together, ſeems a very ſtrong Tradition for the Seventh-day Sabbath.</p>

               <p>And this may alſo ſuffice to ſatisfie the Conſciencious, that this is not a new Doctrine, which ſo many Chriſtians have held, and ſtill hold and practice to this day.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not have thought it meet to have written at all upon this Queſtion, but that I ſee the more Able take it not in hand; by this Eſſay therefore I have endeavoured to provoke ſome other, better furniſhed to clear this up (if need be) to greater ſatisfaction, which I have only a little looked into; and ſuch may find (as I think) much more than I have, who alſo by many Removes under this late Perſecution, have loſt (as I think) divers Authorities which I had collected for my ſhare, in which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48100:64"/> Perſecution I have great cauſe to bleſs God, as giving me leiſure to look into this and other matters.</p>
               <p>I have alſo paſſed by ſome Expreſſions in the Hiſtories in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Firſt day, which are written by the Favourers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Opinion, which are very common in the Writings of the Monks and other <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prelates.</p>
               <p>And now I leave all with the Son of Man, the LORD of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>But, what I have gathered out of a great deal of Rubbiſh, (and before mentioned) may be ſufficient (in my weak Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) to prove to the ſatisfaction of the unprejudic'd, that the Word of God fully, and a ſtrong Tradition, are for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day Sabbath, and againſt the Firſt day.</p>
               <p>And if the Seventh day be the true Chriſtian Sabbath, and that day (and that day only) be commanded to be kept, as it plainly ſeems to me by the Scriptures, and (very far) by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, (except that of <hi>Rome</hi> and its Followers) then do we weekly and wilfully break the Fourth Command, in a point wherein there ſeems no ſound Reaſon can be aſſigned; for, God expreſly commands to keep the Seventh day, and we will keep not that which he commands, but one of thoſe upon which he has commanded us to labour.</p>
               <p>What a learned Noble Gentleman means by his Inequality of days, in his <hi>Coſmical Suſpicions,</hi> I know not. (See <hi>Iſa. 30. 19, 26. Prov. 3. 1, 2, 16. Orek Jammim.</hi>) Nor what of Truth there may be in the Story of <hi>Fluvius Sabbaticus</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which, ſome ſay, only flows; (another, that it only reſts) upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, but divers take notice of it. <hi>Baronius, An. Chr. 33, fol. 28, ſect. 12. Joſephus 7. de bello 24. Plin. 31, Hiſt. 2. &amp;c.</hi> but on theſe I build not.</p>
               <p>And here I think it may be of ſome uſe to beſtow a Sheet or two upon the caſe of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to ſhew how that came in and is held up.</p>
               <p>As to the time of keeping the Paſſover, the Lamb was to be taken up the tenth day of the firſt Moon or Month <hi>Niſan,</hi> which <hi>Niſan</hi> (they ſay) anſwered to part of our <hi>March,</hi> and part of <hi>April,</hi> and was to be killed the fourteenth day of that Month, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 1, - 6.</p>
               <p>The Month <hi>Niſan</hi> I take to be the firſt New Moon after the Vernal Aequinox, which Vernal Aequinox is our Eleventh or Twelfth day of <hi>March;</hi> and whether the Fourteenth day was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48100:65"/> not to be reckoned from the day of the Aequinox (which Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day was alwaies in the Month <hi>Niſan</hi>) I cannot tell. <hi>Lucius, Cent.</hi> 2. 117, D. But this I doubt, and rather take the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Month or Moon <hi>Niſan</hi> began after the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aequinox, and that the Paſchal Lamb was to be killed the Fourteenth day of that Moon: Or, what other Reckoning they had, I cannot certainly reſolve.</p>
               <p>To this Feaſt of the Paſſover (<hi>i. e.</hi> paſſing over the Houſes of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God ſlew the Firſt born of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi>) our Lord's Parents went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> every year, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 41.</p>
               <p>This Paſſover, though it preſerved the Memory of the great Deliverance the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet the Lamb then killed was eminently a Type of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Paſſover was alſo obſerved by Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 26. 1, 17, 18, 19. Mark 14. 12. Luke 22. 7. John</hi> 13. 1. The day when Chriſt went with his Diſciples to keep the Paſſover was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Evening before our <hi>Friday,</hi> and that Evening (<hi>i. e.</hi> the beginning of <hi>Friday</hi>) he and his Diſciples probably began to keep it, and that night he was betray'd and taken, and on <hi>Friday</hi> was crucified; which Paſſover the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved upon the next day after, being the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>The Ancients ſay, the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Cuſtom when two Feaſts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paſſover and the Sabbath, came ſo near together, as to be next one another, that by <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Tradition they obſerved both upon one day, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the Sabbath day.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid thereupon, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> by that Rule, then kept the Paſſover upon the Seventh-day Sabbath (which began in the Evening) which they ſhould have obſerved upon <hi>Friday,</hi> the Sixth day of the week. And that Chriſt kept it upon the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Sixth day, which was the right day, which was the Evening after our <hi>Thurſday, Mark 15. 42. Luke 23. 54. John</hi> 19. 14.</p>
               <p>See <hi>Lucius, Cent. 1, lib. 1. fol.</hi> 259, E, Whether the Apoſtles kept it after the Death of Chriſt I cannot yet reſolve, although in <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 21, the Feaſt which the Apoſtle ſays he was to keep at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſeems to be the Paſſover, though that be not named, and if it were, I think <hi>Paul</hi> took occaſion to be there at that publick great Concourſe of People, to preach Chriſt to that Multitude. And ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8, the Feaſt there ſpoken of might be the Paſſover, though it be not named.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48100:65"/>
               <p>But, that the Apoſtles were under no obligation to keep that Feaſt of the Paſſover, after the Death of Chriſt, is to me paſt doubt, becauſe the Paſſover and Lamb then ſlain were a Type of Chriſt, and prefigured him, who is our Paſchal Lamb, who <hi>being himſelf ſlain and ſacrificed for us, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 7, at his Death the Paſſover, the Type and Figure wholly ceaſed, and was aboliſhed by his Death, the true Antitype, and ſo the Apoſtles, and all others, were by his Death delivered from that, as<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lucius,</hi> Cent. 1.</note> well as other Ceremonies, <hi>which are all nailed to his Croſs,</hi> and the keeping the Feaſt with Unleaveneds, the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 8, expounds of their ſincerity of Life, who believed in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius, Cent. 1. lib.</hi> 2. 36. H, However, there were ſome (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi>) in conformity to the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſſover, though in croſſneſs to the day the <hi>Jews</hi> kept the Paſſover on; or it may be out of a good Intention, in memory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; or for what other reaſon I cannot tell, who (it ſeems by the Hiſtories) did, about the Second and Third Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, obſerve one yearly Feſtival in commemoration of the Reſurrection, which Reſurrection falling out to be the Firſt day of the week, they would have others yearly obſerve upon the Firſt day, which the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches generally oppoſed, thoſe there who kept it keeping it the fourteenth day of the firſt Month, the day Chriſt kept it upon, whatever day of the week it fell out to be: But what Law from Chriſt either they or any others had, or have, to make any ſuch Obſervation now upon either of thoſe days, or upon any other day, I am wholly to ſeek.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved the Paſſover, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 4, where the Paſſover is rendered (<hi>Eaſter.</hi>) And that ſome yearly Feaſt was kept by divers Chriſtians in lieu of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is very likely. <hi>Lucius, 1 Cent. lib. 2. fol.</hi> 387. C, D, where <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangeliſt, and other Apoſtles, are ſaid to keep that yearly Feaſt the fourteenth day of the firſt Moon, and that ſome caſt it (<hi>rejeciſſe</hi>) upon the Dominical day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cent. 2, fol.</hi> 7. C, D, where a Queſtion being moved, Who firſt preached the Goſpel in <hi>Britain?</hi> 'tis ſaid, It does not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appear, but certainly this is not unlikely to Truth, That that Church (<hi>i. e.</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi>) was planted in the beginning by the Grecian or Oriental Teachers, and not by the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Weſtern</hi> Teachers, and that the <hi>Grecians</hi> transferred their Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48100:66"/> and Ceremonies to them; and he ſo thinks, firſt, becauſe <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis Abbas</hi> writing to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> affirms, The <hi>Scots,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> were uſed of old to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Paſſover their time, not the <hi>Roman</hi> time.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, he quotes Cardinal <hi>Galfridus,</hi> who wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, That the <hi>Britains</hi> wholly refuſed to receive <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the younger, the Legate of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great; nor would they acknowledge any Primacy the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had over them: Which <hi>Galfridus</hi> lived about Seven hundred years after Chriſt. So that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Obſervation of the Paſſover was not received in <hi>Britain</hi> for ſome hundred years after Chriſt; and ſo there is that Tradition againſt <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius, Cent. 2, fol.</hi> 89, C, D, E, F, G, H, of the Paſſover, That ſome Obſervations ſtuck long in Chriſtianity, fetch'd from the Old Teſtament, the celebrating the Paſſover in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was accommodated to the Rites and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Jews,</hi> either becauſe being born and educated in <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> they did not underſtand Chriſtian Liberty, or becauſe ſome great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men in the Church thought, that a ſudden abrogating all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites could not be without troubling the Weak; of which opinion was <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who celebrated this Saying, <hi>That the Synagogue was to be buried with Honour;</hi> (but, it ſeems, he thought it muſt be buried.)</p>
               <p>In the obſervation of the Paſſover, it is certain, many Pious and Praiſe-worthy men were tenacious of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtom, for that Diverſity remained from the Apoſtle's times even till <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and long after; for it is not written what time, in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, the Cuſtom of celebrating the Paſſover in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> manner, was wholly abrogated, unleſs that, after a ſharp Diſſention between Pope <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, it was decreed, That no man ſhould ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive that Controverſie. The <hi>French</hi> then obſerved it the Eighth of the Kalends of <hi>April,</hi> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> account.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church they obſerved it upon the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal day, after the fourteenth day of the Moon; and this Pope <hi>Pius</hi> firſt inſtituted. And ſome draw it from the Viſion of the <hi>Hermits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when that Decree was not obſerved by all Churches, (Pope) <hi>Victor,</hi> not without great Diſſention repeated it, and the <hi>Arian</hi> Churches not being willing to receive that Cuſtom, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated them all together.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48100:66"/>
               <p>Here now this (ſays <hi>Lucius</hi>) is to be obſerved, that the Apoſtles and Apoſtolical men never conſtituted any Law, neither of the Paſch (or Paſſover) nor of any other Feſtivals whatſoever, (which do include <hi>Sunday</hi>) but left Liberty ſafe and entire to all; and cites <hi>Socrates,</hi> that neither the Saviour, nor the Apoſtles, commanded this to be obſerved, by any Law.</p>
               <p>So it is here acknowledged, that there was no Law of Chriſt, or of his Apoſtles, for this yearly Obſervation, only <hi>Rome</hi> would have it ſo, and excommunicated thoſe Churches (as above) which would not obey their Will.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cent. 2, fol.</hi> 100, A, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> is ſaid to command the Feaſt of the Paſſover to be celebrated upon the Dominical day.</p>
               <p>And <hi>fol.</hi> 113, D, it's ſaid, That Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> in their Letters command, that the Paſſover ought to be obſerved by all Churches, in the ſame manner: They add a Reaſon, Becauſe it does not become the Members (<hi>i. e.</hi> other Churches) to diffent from the Head, which is the <hi>Roman</hi> See. So the Headſhip was claimed by <hi>Rome</hi> very early, if that be true.</p>
               <p>But of this Reaſon there is ſome doubt, whether it be not foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in, and whether it were then aſſigned; for that Headſhip of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeems not aſſumed in divers Centuries after.</p>
               <p>More to the ſame purpoſe we have <hi>fol.</hi> 117, 118, about the different obſervation of the Paſſover, and that it is evident, the Apoſtles left the Churches at liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fol.</hi> 120, 121, we have Pope <hi>Victor</hi> blamed for his reſoluteneſs to bring all Churches to his Obſervation, and for damning and nick naming them <hi>Quarto decimani</hi> Hereticks, who obſerved the Paſſover the Fourteenth day of the Moon.</p>
               <p>And the Miſchief of this is ſaid to be the greater, for that hereby the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were made more inſolent, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute other Ceremonies, and obtrude them on other Churches. And this was an abuſe of Excommunication, and an Example of excommunicating thoſe, for not obſerving human Traditions, who otherwiſe were of ſound and right Minds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius, fol.</hi> 121, quotes <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> ſaying, That ſome in <hi>Aſia</hi> pertinaciouſly retained their own Manner: Which <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus, lib. 4, cap.</hi> 39, I find, ſpeaks alſo of the Differences that were about Faſting, as well as about the day of the Paſſover-Feſtival; for, ſome thought they ought to faſt but one day,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48100:67"/> others two days, others more days, others meaſured the day by Forty hours Night and Day.</p>
               <p>So great Diverſity and Uncertainty there is in all theſe deviſed Feaſts and Faſts, which God has not appointed.</p>
               <p>And <hi>fol.</hi> 123, 124, we have a little more to like purpoſe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is what I find in the ſecond Century.</p>

And ſeeing that all our Thoughts, Words, and Actions ſhould now be governed, and ſhall at laſt be judged by Chriſt, as our Judge, and by his Law and Word, as the Rule, it behoves us not to reject any Light which he graciouſly offers, to ſet us right, in any part of his Will.</p>
               <p>And as God of old reſerved the more open giving, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and divulging of his Law upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> (and therein this Fourth Command) to the time of his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of literal <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whether he have not alſo reſerved the calling the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches, and thoſe of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches of Chriſt, which have in any ſort ſucked in the like, or any other Corrupt Alterations, to the time of delivering his People out of ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or thereabout, I cannot tell; but that he will ſome time or other reſtore the Knowledge and Practice of his Will in this, I do the more expect, becauſe of his Promiſes by his Holy Spirit, to <hi>teach us all things, John</hi> 14. 26. And for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I ought not to preſcribe, ſo I am indeed no Judge which time is fitteſt, but do plead his Cauſe, in my day, as I think my Duty is, and hold my ſelf, and all others, bound to the obſervance of his Commands, although I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge great Imperfections in our Obedience to every one of the Commands, which nothing can expiate, but the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I remember, ſome had a deſire to keep up Circumciſion, not fully underſtanding that God had aboliſh'd that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, while <hi>Paul</hi> was clear in the Doctrine of laying it aſide; and it often comes to paſs, that God puts a Thought into our Mind, that like a Sun-beam makes a Truth viſible in a moment, which before we could not diſcern.</p>

               <p>And it ſeems to be ſomewhat obſervable, That <hi>Ludovicus</hi> (the Name of a great Prince now in the World) has in the numerical Letters of it the exact number of 666, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18, which Note, as I am now of late credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (ſince the writing of theſe Sheets) has been taken notice of 3 or 4 years ſince, by a learned Doctor and Prelate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it may be ſince by ſome others. And if this be the Meaning of the Holy Spirit in that Place and Context, it has many Conſequences, which much concern the Churches of Chriſt at home and abroad, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>But that, in truth, this Change of the Seventh day was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> let any man who peruſes thoſe few Collections before, about that matter, judge.</p>
               <p>And if the obſervation of the Firſt day, no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Word by the Lord, that I could ever find, or read, or hear of, be an Error, as I conceive it is, <hi>Jehovah</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who is Head of the Church, who loves it, and gave himſelf for it, can by his Word and Holy Spirit cleanſe it from this and all other Miſtakes, which yet remain, and will preſent it a glorious Church, <hi>without ſpot or wrinkle, that it may be holy, and without blemiſh, Eph.</hi> 5. 23, 25, 26, 27.</p>

That no man ought to alter God's Laws; and that Diſputes againſt them are intolerable; and that it is a controuling of the Divine Wiſdom to make any Alteration in his Precepts. <hi>Charn.

               <p>I have heard Mr. <hi>Charnook</hi>'s Practice was to preach upon the Firſt day, but what his Judgment was in the main point I do not remember to have read in thoſe Writings of his, which are in my Hand, Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> of whom mention is made before, I think, might be in Opinion and Practice, for ought
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48100:71"/> I know, for the Firſt day; and of the ſame Opinion have been and are many other worthy men, as has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet ſtill Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law, 1 John 3. 4. And this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments, which are not grievous, 1 John</hi> 5. 3, nor have any thing in them which Men ſhould be unwilling to keep. <hi>The Wiſdom of God appears in his Laws, Charn. Att. f. 412. Submit to his Wiſdom in this Caſe, f.</hi> 413.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Moral Law cannot be aboliſhed or altered in the whole, or any part of it, without Reflection upon the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Law-giver. <hi>Charn. Att. f.</hi> 549.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Man's Glory in the World lies in his Conformity to Chriſt, and our Conformity to him lies in our keeping his Commands; <hi>His Law is holy, Rom. 7. 11. Pure, Pſal.</hi> 19. 8. Holy and pure, as it is a Ray of the pure nature of Chriſt the Law-giver, <hi>f.</hi> 559. though they be never ſo many and great who are of another Opinion.</p>
               <p>The Law to alter the Seventh day to the Firſt, you may ſee before in the Collections out of the Centuries, was by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who though they pretended to diſpenſe with the Laws of the Church, could not alter or diſpenſe with the Laws of God, becauſe no Law can be diſpenſed with, or altered, in any point, by any Authority, but that which is equal to that which enacted it. Now no Pope, or other men on Earth, can pretend to an Authority equal to the Authority of God; ſo as if there be no Divine Precept for any other than the Seventh day, then it is certain, that no Decrees of Popes or Councils, or any Tradition, can be of any force to alter that Law God hath declared to be his Law.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles have made no new Laws about this, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) but left it as they found it: And that neither the Pope, nor any other Power can diſpenſe with the Law of God, I think, has been agreed by all the great Proteſtant Writers, and the Reaſon is evident, The Laws of God are above them, and no Church, or Man, or Men, can diſpenſe with them in any Caſe.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome may ſecretly wiſh that this Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for the keeping holy the Seventh day, were not ſo plain, or that it were expreſſed, (or that they could ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48100:72"/> find it) altered in the Scriptures; becauſe ſo plain a Command, not repealed nor altered there, and ſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſt, faces their Conſciences, anſwers all the Books, and throws down all the Batteries raiſed againſt it. Fain they would find out ſome colourable Objections to ſhelter themſelves in a continual Violation of it, but ſtill that Law riſes up, and overthrows all Oppoſition: They pray to God to <hi>encline</hi> their <hi>Hearts to keep</hi> that <hi>Law,</hi> and yet keep it down what they can, but all will not do.</p>
               <p>GOD, who has reſerved a Tenth of our Subſtance, has reſerved but a Seventh of our Time, which we ſhould neither alter nor begrudge. And indeed, it ſeems to me marvellous, that the obſervation of the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath ſhould be ſo long laid aſide here in a Land of Light, notwithſtanding ſo direct and plain a Command, and that the Firſt day ſhould ſo far obtain, for which we have ſo very little Colour, ſome at firſt by Subtilty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and others by Careleſneſs letting in that Obſervation, and now finding ſome Good by the Ordinances then cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, approve of the day alſo, and have put all their Strength to defend it: An Opinion blown up to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful heighth, which yet God by his Word can eaſily take down.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, ſome have altered, and in part abrogated this old Command, and ſet up a contrary one in its ſtead, and ſo do become (in this) not God's Subjects, but his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers; as if they could make a more holy<note place="margin">See <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi>'s Attrib. <hi>pag.</hi> 75.</note> righteous Law than the Law of God, and have ſo far forſaken God's Law, and <hi>walked after the imagination of their own Hearts, Jer. 9. 31. In this taxing his Wiſdom, as if he did not underſtand, Job</hi> 21. 22, How unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is this, to impoſe any Law upon God, and force him to revoke his own.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, to my weak Underſtanding it ſeems evident,</p>
               <p>That the World was made by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who after the Creation inſtituted the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, reſted on it, ſanctified it, and bleſſed it; and that it was obſerved from the Creation, till it was repeated at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and that there the Commands were given by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48100:72"/> Chriſt the Redeemer to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, (i. e.</hi> to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind); and that ſame Seventh day obſerved by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets till his Incarnation; that the Ten Commands (and therein the Seventh-day Sabbath) were confirmed by <hi>Immanuel</hi> our God and Saviour, after his taking our Nature upon him; that the ſame Seventh-day Sabbath, and no other day of the week, was kept by him during his life here, and that perfectly and conſtantly; and when he had finiſhed the Work of Redemption, that his Body reſted in the Grave the next Seventh-day Sabbath, and himſelf in Heaven (as he reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Seventh day, after he ended the Work of Creation); and that, while he reſted in Heaven, and his Body in the Grave, Believers then reſted alſo, according to the Fourth Command; and (by the Teſtimony of the Scriptures) that the Seventh-day Sabbath was obſerved by the Apoſtles, and all other Believers, after our Lord's Reſurrection, and that conſtantly; and that the Holy Spirit does call the Seventh day only (and no other day of the week) the Sabbath, throughout the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament; and that after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, and after the pouring out of the Holy Spirit; and that there is no Law, nor any Word to be found in the Scriptures (which do<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 17.

Not one word that repeals or alters the Fourth Command in any jot or tittle; nor any Power there given to any (that ever were, are, or ſhall be) in the World, to make any Alteration therein, (and, Who can tell us the perſons authorized from God to do this?)
